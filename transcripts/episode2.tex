    \name{} weaves out of Talan's Tavern, giggling excessively. \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female()}{\HeShe{} is wearing a dark grey, backless dress with a plunging neckline. The hem of the 
        dress
    is slanted so that \hisher{} left leg is exposed up about two-thirds up \hisher{} thigh, while the left is only exposed about a third of the way up \hisher{} thigh. The hem is lined with a large
number of thin, freely hanging tassles.}{\HeShe{} is wearing
        a \pbodytype{tight}{tight}{tight}{loose} dark grey short-sleeved shirt that \pbodytype{shows off}{shows off}{shows off}{slims} \hisher{} 
        \pbodytype{thin, \muscleadj{} build}{lean, \muscleadj{} chest}{large, 
    \muscleadj{} chest}{heavy, \muscleadj{} chest}, and a matching pair of trousers.}

    Carrie bursts out a second later, her eyes wide and bright, and her face flushed. She is wearing a tight, light-grey dress. The bottom of the dress clings like a second 
    skin to her curvy bottom, and only barely covers her bouncy globes. She is laughing feverishly, and gives \name{} a light smack on the bottom. "I can't believe you did that. What were you thinking?"

    "I was thinking that my friend Carrie needed an excuse to ditch him," says \name{}, plopping an arm around her shoulder, and giving it a squeeze. "Aren't I a good friend?"

    "The greatest," says Carrie. She wraps an arm around \names{} waist and returns the squeeze. "But let's get out of here before his beer-addled brain puts two and two together, and comes out 
    looking for a fight."

    As if on cue, there is a great bellow from inside the tavern.

    "Good call," says \name{}. \HeShe{} snaps \hisher{} fingers and creates a small sphere of Spectral Light.  Then, the two hurry into the night. Though their steps are a bit wobbly, they're far
    better than those of their newest nemesis.

    Carrie keeps her arm around \names{} waist all the way back to the Church, her warm hips pressing against \names{}, and her bare leg occasionally brushing against the young Taironan's
    \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female}{equally bare}{covered} thigh.

    Soon, the two are standing at the foot of the stairs leading up into the Church. Carrie pivots so that she is standing in front of \name{}. She flashes the Taironan a dazzling grin. She wraps her
    fingers around \names{} neck, and pulls herself tight against her companion, her ample breasts pressing against \names{}
    \pbodytype{upper chest}{chest}{lower chest}{lower sternum}. She rocks her hips, grinding her pelvis against her friend. "I've got a theory that you've got a crazy hot body, but I can't tell with all this clothing
     in the way. Hows about we go back to your place, and run a little experiment?"

\begin{childnode}{ep2 extrovert carrie desire denial}{Andrew Russell}

    Despite \hisher{} words, \names{} hips grind against Carrie's, and \hisher{} nipples stiffen beneath the painfully thin wool of \hisher{} dress. A warm, electric sensation flows through \hisher{}
    torso and gathers between \hisher{} legs.

    "Why not?" asks Carrie. Her voice is soft, her lips centimeters from \names{} and drawing closer. Her left hand begins kneading one of \names{} shoulders, while her right
    slides down \names{} torso, and begins lightly rubbing \names{} hip. "I want you, and you clearly want me."

    "Because..." says \name{} breathlessly, \hisher{} chest heaving. Blood pounds in \hisher{} ears, while Carrie's faint, flowery perfume fills \hisher{} nostrils. \HisHer{} eyes are riveted by
    Carrie's wide brown eyes. The pale girl's hips sway sinuously, and the faint rustle of cotton on cotton wafts through the cool night air. "Isn't your Church all about having children? We can't-"

    "The only people who claim crap like that aren't worth listening to," murmurs Carrie. "Besides you're dodging the question."

    "I'm not dodging-oww!"

    Carrie's right hand reaches around \names{} hip and gives \hisher{} \pbodytype{slender}{round}{voluptuous}{expansive} bottom a sharp slap. 

    \name{} pouts, and rubs \hisher{} bottom, but doesn't pull away from Carrie. "I'm just not interested in women."

    "You're gonna get that cute bottom of yours spanked if you keep lying to yourself like that," says Carrie.

    "I'm not--"

    "You spend at least half the time we're together ogling me. Every time we've gone out, as soon as you start getting a little bit tipsy, you start flirting with me. The more you drink, the closer
    you dance to me, and the
    more risque your dancing gets. I can hear you panting, I can feel your chest heave, and your hips rub against mine." She leans in close and whispers into \names{} ear, her warm breath tickling 
    \names{} earlobe. "There's nothing wrong with wanting a woman. We make better lovers anyway."

    Carrie moans against \names{} moist lips, and pumps her hips against the Taironan's, and pushes her chest against \names{}. A sharp, hot surge of pleasure
    spreads all the way down \names{} front, from \hisher{} eager lips, to \hisher{} nipples, to \hisher{} tingling pussy. Carrie pulls away slightly, and looks into \names{} eyes, an eager smile on her plump lips. "You eager minx. 
    Should probably get off the street, though. Someone might see us."
    
    \name{} takes Carrie's hand, and begins to guide her back towards \names{} home. "Come on, then. The night isn't getting any younger."

    Soon, the two are standing outside \names{} door. \name{} opens it, and ushers Carrie in. As Carrie enters the dark room, \name{} eases the door shut, then
    grabs Carrie's curvy hips, and thrusts \hisher{} pelvis against the blonde's firm, protruding, bouncy bottom. Carrie moans, and leans against \name{}, crushing the Taironan's 
    \pbodytype{small}{average}{ample}{large} breasts against her back, her hands reaching behind her to caress \names{} face. \name{} thrusts against Carrie's bottom a second time. Carrie pushes her hips back, and
    starts to bounce her bottom up and down, and \name{} groans. \HeShe{} guides Carrie towards \hisher{} \cond{'boarding\_with\_Adrian' in pwutilities.keywords()}{bed}{blankets}. \HeShe{} pushes the young student 
    facedown into the blankets, and wiggles the blonde's tight skirt up over her deliciously curvy hips, exposing
    her round, bubbly cheeks, clad only in a tiny G-String.

    "You know, there are other types of panties out there," says \name{}, kneading Carrie's succulent bottom, and giving it a few light smacks, just hard enough to make the soft flesh ripple.

    "Uhhh. It's not my fault I keep running out of fabric," says Carrie, thrusting her bottom up against \names{} hands. 

    "Of course not," says \name{}, pulling off \hisher{} own dress, and slipping out of \hisher{} panties. \HeShe{} begins sliding Carrie's dress up her smooth, arched back, while rubbing \hisher{} 
    vulva against the other woman's pillowy bottom. "You're just a victim of circumstance."

    "Exactly," moans Carrie, as \name{} pulls the dress free, and flings it to the side. "Oh, woe is me!"

    "I'll take that as a yes," says Carrie breathlessly when \name{} comes up for air. She puts her hands on \names{} chest, and grins up at him. 
    \cond{'taking\_Carrie\_home' in pwutilities.keywords()}{"I get to be on top this time. Gonna ride you like a pony."}{"Took you long enough. I was starting to get impatient."}

    \cond{'taking\_Carrie\_home' in pwutilities.keywords()}{"Oh? Where are we going?" asks \name{}, kissing Carrie again.}
    {"Well, we can't have that, now can we?" says \name{}, running \hisher{} hand down Carrie's back.} %This line is not being tokenized correctly. It's supposed to be grouped with the line above, but it is not.

    \cond{'taking\_Carrie\_home' in pwutilities.keywords()}{"And people call me cheeky," says Carrie. She starts to tug \name{} towards the street. "Come on. It's sexy time."}
    {"Indeed. It'd be a tragedy for the ages," says Carrie. She starts to pull \name{} in the general direction of \hisher{} home. "Now come on, it's sexy time."}

    \cond{'taking\_Carrie\_home' in pwutilities.keywords()}{Carrie sticks her tongue out at \himher{}.}{"Magic."}

    Soon, the two are pushing their way into \names{} room, their tongues intertwined, and their hands exploring every crevice of the other's body. When they reach \names{}
    \cond{'boarding\_with\_Adrian' in pwutilities.keywords()}{bed}{blankets}, they half-fall, half-kneel onto the blankets. Carrie gives \name{} a light shove, pushing \himher{} onto \hisher{} back. She straddles \himher{}, 
    and leans down to give \himher{} a kiss.
    As Carrie's plump lips meet \hishers{}, \name{} wraps \hisher{} arms around her back and pulls her tight against \hisher{} chest. \HeShe{} groans as the woman's soft, succulent breasts press 
    against
    \hisher{} \pmusculature{slender}{toned}{muscled} pecs. Carrie begins to rock forward and back. \names{} hands slide down to Carrie's curvy bottom, and begin to tug up her dress. 

    Carrie breaks the kiss and rocks her hips. "Hmm. Someone's getting a little eager."

    \name{} grins as he tugs Carrie's dress up over her hips. He pauses long enough to slide \hisher{} right hand down Carrie's bare left cheek. "No panties? Tsk tsk. Naughty girl."
    
    Carrie puts a hand to her chest and takes on an expression of mock hurt. "I'm totally wearing panties."

    "I'm not finding any evidence of them," says \name{}. He slides \hisher{} left hand down Carrie's equally bare right cheek.

    "No. No no no no." Alondra's sharp voice cuts through the midnight air. "I am not going to stay up half the night listening to you two have sex

    \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female()}{"Silly girl, nobody's forcing you to just sit and listen," says Carrie, turning and smiling at Alondra.}{"Don't be ridiculous," says Carrie, grinning. "\name{} doesn't have that kind of endurance."}

    Alondra curses. "It is the middle of the night. Do you have any idea how early I have to get up tomorrow? Do you have any idea how late I was up cleaning the kitchen, while you and your little

\begin{childnode}{ep2 take carrie home alondra fight}{Andrew Russell}

    Alondra grits her teeth. She grabs something off of her end table, gets up, steps up to \names{} bed and looms. 
    
    Carrie quietly slithers off of \name{}, and plops down at the end of the bed. She slips a strand of hair into her mouth.

    \name{} sits up in bed, crosses \hisher{} arms and smirks. "Yeah? Says you and what army?"

    "My hairbrush." Alondra grabs \names{} arm. "Now get that \cond{universal.state.player.bodyType == 'voluptuous' or universal.state.player.bodyType == 'heavyset'}{fat}{scrawny} ass of yours over my knee!"

    "No."

    "Selfish brat." Alondra yanks on \names{} arm. "You're getting a paddling, whether you like it or not."

    \name{} wrenches \hisher{} arm free, grabs Alondra's wrist, and yanks the woman forward. As Alondra lurches, \name{} grabs her around the shoulders, and pushes the young woman across \hisher{} knee. 

    "Hey! Let go of me," cries Alondra, drumming her feet against the ground. But \name{} holds the struggling girl easily. A side-effect of many hours spent in the various sparring rooms. "When I tell Ildri-"
    
    "You know, \nickname{}, maybe--" says Carrie.

    "Yeah, yeah, yeah, hide behind Ildri's apron strings." \name{} picks up Alondra's dropped hairbrush, and flips up Alondra's nightgown. "The only selfish brat in this room is you. And the only one getting a spanking is you."
    
    Alondra snarls. She reaches back and tries to slap \name{} across the face, but \name{} catches her wrist, and pins it against her lower back. 

    "Maybe we can--" says Carrie.

    \name{} strikes Alondra's right cheek with the heavy hairbrush. The solid sound of bone on bare flesh echoes. Alondra's fleshy cheek flattens and bounces beneath the blow. Her hips jump,
    and her feet scrabble against the wooden floor. A sharp cry bursts from her lips.

    "I won't warn you again," says Alondra. "Let goww!"

    \name{} starts paddling Alondra faster. \HeShe{} tries to cover Alondra's mouth with \hisher{} hand, but the girl is squirming so badly, \name{} needs \hisher{} full arm to keep the girl 
    pinned across \hisher{} thigh. Finally, \heshe{} gives up, and just lets Alondra howl, while \heshe{} paddles the other girl.

    Then the door bursts open, and Ildri stands in the doorway, with her hands on her large hips. A few curious faces peek over Ildri's shoulder, and through the crook of her arms.

    The cook takes the whole scene in at a glance, and her expression darkens dangerously. She steps into the room, and closes the door. "Do either of you know how late it is? Or how much noise you're making?"

    "Don't look at me. Alondra's just being an ass," says \name{} landing a few more thwacks to the center of Alondra's right cheek.

    "Oww! I'm the ass? You're the one who brought that blonde bimbo-oww!" Alondra bucks and kicks beneath a particularly sharp blow to her right sitspot.

    "Excuse me?" says Carrie, starting to crawl across the bed towards Alondra. "I'll show you--oww!"
    
    Ildri gives Carrie's bouncy bottom a sharp slap. "Don't you get involved. Spanking two bottoms at once is going to be hard enough."

    "What?" say \name{} and Alondra in sync, \name{} frozen in mid smack, and Alondra in mid squirm.

    Ildri steps forward and grabs \names{} wrist. "Alondra get up. The two of you have woken up half the city with your carrying on. So I think the both of you could learn a little consideration."

    Alondra rolls of \names{} lap. "But that's not fair! I didn't do anything."

    "You didn't do anything?" says \name{}, glaring at Alondra. "You're the one who started carrying on, because you couldn't step outside for a quarter glass-"

    "I shouldn't have to," says Alondra, scrambling to her feet. "This is my room--"

    "It's my room too--"

    "Enough," says Ildri. She jerks \name{} to \hisher{} feet, and lands three sharp blows to \hisher{} \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female()}{dress-clad}{trousers-clad} bottom. Then, she lets go of \name{} long enough to grab
    Alondra, spin her around, and land three blows to the seat of her thin nightgown.

    \name{} tries to bolt for the door, but Ildri spins and grabs \hisher{} upper arm. "Oh no. You're not going anywhere. When I'm done with the two of you--"

    "By why are you spanking me?" whines Alondra. She points at \name{}. "I didn't do anything. It was all \hisher{} fault!"

    "Madre's tits it is," says \name{}, reaching around Ildri and smacking Alondra. "You're the one who threw a hissy fit!"

    "Oww! \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female()}{Bitch!}{Asshole!}" Alondra returns the smack with one of her own.

    Ildri growls. She marches the two \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female()}{girls}{Taironans} to \names{} bed. Then she sits down, and hauls the both of them across her large thighs, Alondra pressed 
    against Ildri's torso, and \name{} pressed against Alondra. Despite their rapidly worsening predicament, the two continue to shove and slap at each other.

    With two brusque motions, Ildri yanks \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female()}{up \names{} dress and Alondra's nightgown}{down \names{} trousers, and yanks up Alondra's nightgown}, exposing a pair of quivering brown bottoms. 
    \pisbaring{\names{} round cheeks are practically bursting out of \hisher{} 
    teeny tiny \underwear{},}{\names{} round cheeks strain against the thin cloth of \hisher{} \underwear{},}{\names{} bare cheeks bounce into view, exposing everything to Ildri's stern gaze,} 
    while Alondra's protruding, curvy bottom is completely naked. Their naked legs 
    grind against each other, while the two shove and slap at each other.
    
    Ildri raises her large, callused hand, and lands a quick one-two to the exposed, naughty behinds of the two brats across her lap. 

    The two yelp, and they finally stop slapping at each other.

    Ildri raises her hand a third time, and smashes it against Alondra's right cheek, and \names{} left cheek simultaneously. The two brats squeal and squirm.

    "Wait, wait Ildri I'm sorry," says Alondra, craning around to look at Ildri with wide, pleading eyes. "I didn't mean it, please--oww!"

    Ildri's hand smashes against Alondra's left cheek, her face a thunderstorm. The girl's hips jump, and press hard against \names{}, while her kicking right leg gets entangled in \names{} left.

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{ep2 ildri double spanking apologize}{Andrew Russell}

    "Glad to hear it," says Ildri, her hand not slowing. "Now, let's make sure you mean it."

    "Wait, wait we do mean it, we do! Please don't--oww!" cries the two \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female()}{girls}{Taironans}. 

    Ildri's hand rises and falls, rises and falls. It thwacks sensitive sitspots, and quivering globes. It pushes away kicking legs. Sometimes it alternates between cheeks, and other times cracks
    against the same spot until the chastised owner is begging Ildri to spank somewhere else, anywhere else! Then, it smacks a thigh, before turning its attention to the other pair of orbs.

    "I am ashamed of you two," says Ildri. She lands half a dozen quick blows to Alondra's left sitspot, then half a dozen quick blows to \names{} right.

    The two yelp, and cling to each other, all animosity forgotten in a desperate need for comfort, any comfort at all.

    "Alondra." Ildri's voice is as sharp as the slap to the middle of Alondra's right cheek. "What were you thinking?"

    "\HeShe{} had no right to bring a girl in without my permission," says Alondra. She sniffles.

    "Does \heshe{} make a habit of it?" asks Ildri.

    "Well, no..."

    "And I take it you never worked out an arrangement for private time?" says Ildri. "Just hoped \name{} would never bring someone home, thinking you wouldn't mind just one night?" 

    Alondra shakes her head. 

    Ildri slaps Alondra's right cheek. "You going to communicate better next time?"

    "Yes ma'am," says Alondra.

    Ildri slaps the middle of Alondra's bottom, right across her crack. "Good. Now, let's make sure you two never make a ruckus like this again."    

    There is a sharp slap, and Alondra cries out. Her hot thigh presses against \names{}, while her grip on \names{} hand tightens.

    A long staccato of cracks assault \names{} ears. Alondra whimpers, yelps and cries. Her hips buck and grind, bumping repeatedly against 
    \names{}.

    "Now," says Ildri, rubbing her hand across \names{} stinging bum. "It's \nicknames{} turn."

    \name{} whimpers, and squeezes \hisher{} eyes shut.

    Ildri lands a hard smack to \names{} right sitspot. "Care to explain your actions?"

    "I just wanted to have some fun," mutters \name{}. 

    "And you didn't consider that maybe you should talk to your roommate before barging in, kissing and moaning and thrusting?" says Ildri.

    \name{} shifts on Ildri's lap. "No. I mean, come on it's just one night. Not like I'm making a habit of it."

    Ildri smacks \names{} left cheek. "One night or a dozen, it's still inconsiderate. Understand?"

    "Yes ma'am," mutters \name{}.

    "Good. Now, let's drive that lesson home," says Ildri. \cond{universal.state.player.wearing\_underwear()}{She grabs the waistband of \names{}
    \cond{universal.state.player.underwear().baring}{teeny}{thin} \underwear{} and tugs \itthem{universal.state.player.underwear()} down to \names{} knees.}{}

    \name{} groans. \HeShe{} reflexively clenches \hisher{} bottom, and squeezes \hisher{} thighs together. Then there is a sharp crack, and another wave of pain washes across \names{} bottom.
    \name{} starts to cry. \HisHer{} naked hips squirm desperately, rubbing against the rough wool of Ildri's nightgown, and pressing against 
    Alondra's warm hip. \HisHer{} legs kick in time with Ildri's heavy blows, while \hisher{} right hand grabs Ildri's ankle in a deathgrip, and 
    \hisher{} left tightens its hold on Alondra's. The young woman's hand is small comfort, but it's comfort nonetheless.

    Finally, Ildri gives them another overlapped slap, then rolls her eyes at Carrie. "Two \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female()}{girls}{young adults} sharing a room, and they don't set up sex rules? What is up with 
    kids these days?" 

    "We're all just full of foolishness," says Carrie with a nervous smile. She is chewing on a strand of hair, her eyes fixated on \names{} and Alondra's red bottoms.

    "Indeed," says Ildri. "Well, here's how it's going to work. After dinner, \name{} has the room to \himselfherself{} for two glasses, while Alondra helps me clean up after dinner. Then, Alondra gets two glasses of 
    private time. You interrupt each other's time, and you're getting spanked. Get it?"

    "Yes ma'am," say Alondra and \name{}.

    "Alright, now I don't want to hear another peep out of either of you until tomorrow morning." Ildri guides the two chastised \cond{universal.state.player.is\_female()}{girls}{Taironans} off her lap. The two hiss and clutch at
    their burning bottoms, dancing little dances.

    Ildri stands and leaves, as she opens the door, she bellows. ``What are you all still doing out here? Get your asses in bed before I tan the lot of you!" 

    There is a loud scrabbling as frantic adventurers bolt for their beds.
    Meanwhile, \name{} and Alondra glare sulkily at each other, and rub their stinging bottoms.

    "So," says Carrie. "I'd be happy to rub your..."

    Both Taironans glare at the Sister-in-training, before shuffling off to their own beds.

    "Aww come on, don't be like that," says Carrie. "Do you have any idea how many times I've been over somebody's knee? I'm an expert bum rubber, I promise."

    "Just let me sleep," mutters Alondra, crawling into bed and pulling her covers over her head.

    "Let's just go to bed," says \name{}, gingerly removing \hisher{} outfit, and crawling into bed. \HeShe{} winces, and slowly eases \himselfherself{} onto \hisher{} stomach, rubbing \hisher{} bottom and cursing 
    silently.

    Carrie slips out of her own clothing, and slides in behind \name{}. She presses her breasts against \names{} back, and begins slowly kneading \names{} tender bottom with soft fingers. 

    \name{} sighs, and closes \hisher{} eyes. "Next time, we're going to your place."

    "Tried that once," says Carrie, nuzzling against \names{} neck. "It didn't end well."

    "Couldn't end much worse than this," mumbles \name{}.

    "Nah, this wasn't bad. A bare bottom OTK hand spanking is nothing compared to a bare bottom switching," says Carrie. "Turns out the Church only tolerates our fun when it's not happening inside their cathedral. Plausible 
    deniability, probably."

    "Hmm..."

    Carrie closes her eyes, and wiggles closer against \name{}. "Yeah."

   "\name{}!" cries Alondra, sounding hurt.

   WHAMWHAMWHAMWHAMWHAM!

   \name{} unleashes a long, high-pitched howl.

   "You cruel, insolent little brat," hisses Ildri, her hand smacking every centimeter of \names{} \bumadj{}, \quivering{}, naked cheeks.

   "Doesn't matter how hard you spank--oww!" cries \name{}, kicking \hisher{} legs. "I still won't be sorryaaah!"

   "Sounds like a challenge," says Ildri. "I accept."

   Ildri's hand begins to rise and fall faster. \names{} \muscleadj{} globes \quiver{} wildly beneath the bombardment, and an all-consuming sting burns across them. Ildri's hard,
   callused hand smashes repeatedly into every centimeter of \names{} \bumadj{} flesh, until \hisher{} entire bottom is a white-hot mass of pain.

   \name{} kicks and bucks. Cries of pain burst from \hisher{} lips with every blow. \HisHer{} hips squirm frantically, pushing Alondra against Ildri's torso, forcing Ildri to pause periodically and readjust \names{} position. On the one hand, the slight pauses are 
   like manna from heaven. On the other, they seem to make the (inevitably) resumed
   spanking all the more painful.

   Ildri even begins sharply slapping \names{} bare thighs, making the chastised \boygirl{} squeal.
  
   "Ok, Ok I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Alondra's not a bitch! I'm suh, suh, sorreee!" wails \name{} after a mere three blows to \hisher{} sensitive thighs.

    "Good. Now we can get back to your proper punishment."

    "What?" cries \name{}. \HeShe{} reaches back to clutch \hisher{} scalding cheeks. "But I thought--"

    "That was for being an unrepetent little brat," says Ildri, pushing \names{} hand away. "Now, I can start punishing you for being an inconsiderate roommate, and for waking up the rest of us with your
    childish argument."

    \name{} moans, and starts to cry. "Please, Ildri, I can't anymore. I'm really really sorry, and I won't do it again, I promise."

    \stageDirections{Alondra insists on giving both \name{} and Carrie half a dozen strokes with her hairbrush for being so inconsiderate, then agrees to set aside some time each evening after dinner for the two to get it on if they so desire.}

    "Well you did disturb me," says Alondra sharply, tugging at her sleep-gnarled hair.

    \name{} hangs \hisher{} head, and picks at the bedsheets.

    "Aww, come on, don't you think you're being a little unfair?" asks Carrie. 

    Alondra shoots a scowl at Carrie. "\HeShe{} knew \heshe{} has a roommate. \HeShe{} knew I need to get up at the ass-crack of dawn tomorrow. Hell, you knew we shared a room, and I need to get up at the ass-crack of dawn tomorrow. There's no excuse for

    "Well maybe--"

    "Carrie," says \name{}, putting a hand on Carrie's arm. "Alondra's right."

    Carrie grumbles a bit, then gives Alondra a hopeful look. "Are you sure you don't want to join us? Blue walls suck. It'd solve all our problems."

    "Yes, I'm sure I don't want to join you," says Alondra 

    Carrie crosses her arms and pouts. "Shoulda gone home with the lumberjack."

    "Wasn't he married?" asks \name{}.

    "What makes you say that?" says Carrie quickly. "He wasn't wearing a bracelet--"

    "Yeah, but there was a tanline around his left wrist," says \name{}. 

    Carrie taps her chin thoughtfully. "Huh. Never thought to look for something like that."

    Alondra rolls her eyes. "Whatever. How about you two get a few hours after dinner every day? I'm stuck in the kitchen and mess hall for at least two hours after dinner, helping Ildri clean up 
    after the adventurers. Filthy creatures."

    "Works for me," says \name{}, crawling beneath \hisher{} covers.

    "Sure," says Carrie. She shucks off her dress and crawls into \names{} bed.

    Alondra narrows her eyes. "You better not--"

    "Relax," says Carrie. "I'm just going to bed. If I'm not going to get any action tonight, I'd at least like to get some sleep."

    Alondra gives Carrie a suspicious look before crawling back into bed. She pulls the covers up, and rolls onto her side, away from Carrie and \name{}.

    \name{} turns towards Carrie, who is lying facing away from \name{}. \name{} wraps one arm around the woman's waist, and pushes \himselfherself{} up against Carrie's mostly bare flesh.

    Carrie sighs, and rocks. "Keeping me warm?"

    Carrie turns and blows \name{} a kiss. "I gotta get going."

    "Not gonna stay for breakfast?" asks \name{}.

    Carrie glances out the window, likely estimating the time. "Better not. If I don't get back to the Church and changed soon, I won't sit for a week. But stop by later today, will you? I'm going

    She pulls on her slippers, then hurries out the door, giving \name{} one last wave.

    \names{} hand closes over Carrie's upper arm, and \heshe{} starts dragging her towards the church.

    Carrie's expression goes from sultry to anxious in an instant. She tugs vainly on \names{} grip of iron, and digs her heels into the cobblestone. "Wait, stop, ok, so you don't want to have sex, I get it, I'm sorry, come on it's not a big deal. You're overreacting."

    \name{} pulls Carrie up the steps.

    "You stupid prude," says Carrie, pounding her free fist against \names{} bicep. "Mother's love, who ever heard of spanking someone because they wanted to have sex with you?"

    \name{} scowls at Carrie, before turning and pulling open one of the large double doors. "Not everyone has sex at the drop of a hat."

    "So you just say no," says Carrie. She grabs the stair railing in a white-knuckled grip, keeping \name{} from dragging her inside. "I'd have backed off." 

    "I did say no," says \name{}. \HeShe{} tugs on Carrie, but the woman just tightens her grip on the railing.

    "I thought you were kidding. It's not my fault you suck at communication," says Carrie.

    \name{} growls. "You know. I could just bend you over the railing and spank you here, in front of the whole damned city."

    Carrie steals a glance back at the courtyard. At this late hour, the courtyard is mostly empty. Emphasis on mostly. She turns back to \name{}, a pleading expression her face. "You wouldn't."

    \name{} grabs Carrie's shoulder and spins her around so that she's facing the railing. \HeShe{} presses \hisher{} hand between her shoulder blades, and starts to bend her over. 

    "Wait wait wait stop stop," cries Carrie, snatching her hand away from the railing. "I'm going, I'm going." 

    \name{} guides Carrie into the shrine, and pulls the large door closed. The room is empty, the small statue of the Mother sitting on the altar their only company.

    As soon as the door closes, Carrie stomps her foot. "This is stupid. Why do you have to be such a--yee!"

    \name{} tugs Carrie forward and bends her over the back of the nearest pew, her bottom blooming into a full moon, the tight, protruding cheeks pressing tightly against her short dress. 
    The dress rides up a little, giving a peek at the lower curves of her 
    quivering bottom.

    "This isn't fair!" Carrie squirms in \names{} grip, her bottom swaying back and forth. "I just want to have a little--oww!"

    \names{} slightly cupped hand snaps down and up, catching Carrie's right cheek at the bottom of the dress and pushing upward. Carrie's cheek bounces up and down, and the girl squirms. \names{} hand snaps down again, this time catching Carrie's left cheek. 
    Carrie yelps and squirms, her legs flexing and kicking.

    \name{} shakes \hisher{} head. "Cut the act Carrie. You've been spanked too many times for a few swats to elicit this kind of reaction."

    "Your hand hurts," says Carrie. She reaches back to cup her bottom, and gives \name{} a doe-eyed look, her bottom lip quivering ever so slightly. "I've learned my lesson I promise."

    \name{} removes one of Carrie's slippers.

    Carrie's eyes widen. "No. Come on no, please not the slipper."

    "I was going to just use my hand, but then you had to try to get out of your punishment with crocodile tears."  \name{} slaps the slipper against \hisher{} own thigh. Carrie winces at the sharp 
    report.

    Carrie's face contorts like a three year old's during a tantrum. She slams her palm against the pew seat. "That's not fair!"

    "Neither is having to literally beat you off with a stick." \name{} claps \hisher{} left hand over the small of Carrie's back and cracks the slipper against the girl's right cheek.

    Carrie yelps and hops a little bit, her jittery cheek bouncing and rolling. \name{} cracks the slipper against Carrie's left cheek, and Carrie yelps again as the blow ripples across her left globe. \name{} settles into a staccato, right-left, right-left rhythm. 
    Carrie's upthrust bottom rolls and bounces beneath the swift blows, her hips rocking, and her legs dancing.

    "I hate you!" screams Carrie, hopping her hips up and down after a particularly hard blow to her left sitspot. "You ugly brute! Go die in a fire!"

    \names{} retort consists of a quartet of moderately light (but still stinging) smacks to the backs of Carrie's thighs. Carrie yelps, and tries to jerk her leg away from the slipper, only to bang her knee against the back of the pew.

    Carrie curses, and reaches back to rub her knee. \name{} takes a step back and lets her.

    "You gonna stop carrying on now?" asks \name{}.

    Carrie glares at \name{}. "Ass."

    "Immature brat." \name{} plants \hisher{} hand back on Carrie's lower back and raises the slipper.

    "What is going on here?" asks a stern voice from the back of the Shrine.

    Carrie eeps, and her face turns even redder.

    \name{} looks up to see Sister Samantha, swathed in a thick robe, standing inside a doorframe with her hands on her hips. Her hair is all over the place, and a small scowl planted firmly on her face.

    "Sorry Sister," says \name{} hesitantly. "Carrie...erm, wouldn't take no for an answer."

    "I see," says Sister Samantha, glaring at Carrie. 

    Carrie turns her face away from Sister Samantha and pouts. "I just wanted to have some fun."

    Samantha grimaces. "Carrie, how would you feel if a man you weren't interested in kept pushing after you said no?"

    "I wouldn't--"

    "Don't give me that. Even you won't sleep with everyone," says Samantha.

    Carrie's pout fades. She gnaws on her lip and shoots a quick glance at \name{}, before studying the backs of her hands in minute detail.

    "Answer me, child," says Samantha.

    "I'd probably be a little bit uncomfortable," mutters Carrie. "Maybe even a little bit scared."

    "Well, I wasn't really scared," says \name{}, shrugging.

    "But you were uncomfortable," says Samantha.

    \name{} shrugs again. "Yeah." 

    "Both of you come with me," says Sister Samantha, turning on her heel. "\name{}, you're going to continue this in my office, where you won't wake up half the Church."

    The two follow after Samantha, Carrie hunched and gently rubbing her bottom, her eyes downcast.

    Soon, they're in Samantha's office, with Carrie bent over the woman's padded desk, her dress gathered at her waist, and her pink bottom clenching and unclenching in dread.

    Samantha gestures for \name{} to continue the slippering. \name{} takes a deep breath, and puts \hisher{} hand on the small of Carrie's back. Carrie sucks in a breath. \name{} draws back, and snaps the slipper against Carrie's right cheek. The fleshy orb wobbles,
    and Carrie hops and yelps.

    "You need to spank her harder than that," says Samantha, folding her hands in front of her, and resting them against her waist. "Trust me, she carries on like you're poking her with red-hot 
    irons, but that's just a ploy to keep the spanking light. You don't give it to her hard and
    fast, and you'll just be wasting your time."

    "That's not true," cries Carrie. "It does hurt, I swear."

    Sister Samantha presses her lips together for a moment. "She talks like I haven't spanked her hundreds of times over the past few years. I'll tell you when she's actually contrite."

    \name{} draws the slipper back and cracks it harder against Carrie's right cheek. As soon as the slipper connects, \name{} draws it back again and strikes Carrie's left cheek. Carrie yelps, and bucks her hips, her cheeks rolling and rippling. \name{} cracks
    the slipper against Carrie's right sitspot, then the middle of her right cheek, then two-thirds down in a rapid 1-2-3. Then \heshe{} does the exact same thing to the left cheek. Then \heshe{} starts rapidly alternating between cheeks, drawing back for the next
    blow almost as soon as the previous lands.

    Carrie howls and squirms through the slippering. Her hips buck and her bottom sways. Her legs jitter, and her hair flips through the air as she shakes her head.

    \name{} casts a quick look at Samantha, who nods for \himher{} to continue. She does. Carrie squeals even louder, and bucks even harder, the red blush on her cheeks deepening
    with every blow.

    After another minute or so of fast, merciless strokes, Carrie collapses onto the desk and sobs, her breath coming in deep, fast gulps.

    "Alright," says Samantha. "I think she's learned her lesson. Have you Carrie?"

    "Yes ma'am," says Carrie, sniffing, and wiping her nose with her sleeve. "No means no, and I shouldn't try to trick \nickname{} into thinking a spanking hurts more than it does. I should accept my spankings like a good girl."

    "Very good," says Samantha. She turns and pulls a long, thin cane off the wall.

    Carrie gasps, and her eyes go wide. "What--"

    "I've spanked you. I've paddled you. I've strapped you. And still you insist on wearing these absurd, inappropriate, non-existent panties," says Sister Samantha, stepping forward and tugging gently on Carrie's G-string. "To say nothing of your dress. Don't think
    I didn't notice how your naked bottom peaked out from underneath it when you first bent over the desk. Well, enough is enough. From now on, it's a panty check every morning, one every night before you go out, and one every night when you get home. And whenever
    you fail your check, it's half a dozen with the cane, wherever we happen to be."

    "No! Not a panty check, please," says Carrie, twisting around to give Sister Samantha a pleading look. "That's sooo humiliating!"

    Samantha hits the desk with her cane. The loud bang makes Carrie wince.

    "But it's so humiliating," wails Carrie.

    "Just be glad I'm not dressing you," says Sister Samantha. 

    Carrie mutters something less than complimentary.

    against \hisher{}

    bare 
    skin
    touching ever so lightly against \names{} hips. \names{} stomach tightens, and \heshe{} opens \hisher{} legs slightly, pressing them a hair more against Alondra's.

    "You have very nice hair," says Alondra, just before her hairbrush runs into a knot. "Stubborn hair. But nice hair." 
    
    She starts tugging.

    "Oww!" yelps \name{}, reaching back to grab \hisher{} hair. "Careful."

    "Oh, hush," says Alondra, guiding \names{} hands away. "Seriously, if you can take getting stabbed, you can take a rough hair brushing."

    "No. I don't want to."

    "Oh really?" says Alondra, her hot breath tickling \names{} ear. Her fingers begin to dance across \names{} sides, sending squirmy tingles through \names{} skin. "You better 
    lean forward right now, or I'll have no choice but to punish you."

    \name{} turns \hisher{} head, flashes a mischievous grin, then leans further back.

    "Ohh, that does it." Alondra drops the hairbrush. The fingers of one of her hands slip up and begin dancing lightly across the skin of \names{} neck, while the fingers of the other start crawling 
    across \names{} stomach.

    \HeShe{} can feel the rapid rise and fall Alondra's breathing, the soft grind of the woman's shapely legs against \hisher{} own. \HeShe{} can even feel the rapid thud of Alondra's 
    heartbeat. Or maybe that's \hisher{} own. 

    "Surrender," hisses Alondra into \names{} ear, the hand tickling \names{} neck slips down, and starts tickling \hisher{} armpit.

    "Never," says \name{} breathlessly, as \hisher{} squirming intensifies.

    "Then you leave me no choice." Alondra wraps one arm around \names{} waist. With the other (and her legs), she heaves herself slightly off the bed, and spins around, rolling on top of
    \name{}.

    \name{} gasps as Alondra's warm softness is replaced with the softer (but cooler) bed. \HeShe{} finds \himselfherself{} looking up at Alondra's cheerily determined face. Alondra straddles \name{},
    locking her legs around \names{} hips. 

    "You know," says \name{} breathlessly. "Can't comb my hair from there."

    "Who said I was going to comb your hair?" Alondra leans forward slightly, and begins mercilessly tickling \names{} sides. She grins wolfishly.

    \name{} squeals and giggles, \hisher{} body writhing ever more desperately beneath Alondra's dancing fingertips.

    "Ok, ok, I surrender!" cries \name{} through \hisher{} laughter.

    "Are you going to let me comb your hair properly?" asks Alondra, her eyes inches from \names{}.

    "Yes, yes," says \name{}.

    "Are you sorry for not letting me comb your hair?" asks Alondra.

    "Yes, yes I'm sorry. I won't do it again."

    "Liar." Alondra gives \name{} one last tickle.

    \name{} pouts. "I'm not a liar, I swear."

    "Oh yeah?" Alondra's voice is soft, and her eyes flick up and down, taking in \names{} prone, panting form. Her lips are inches from \names{}, and her hands cup \names{} torso, pressing ever so

    Alondra's strokes stop for a moment. "Crowded. Five kids, you know? And only two parents."

    "One now, though right? Didn't you say your mom had passed?" asks \name{}.

    "Right. Yeah. Forget sometimes, you know?" says Alondra, her voice strangely emotionless considering the subject matter.

    "Yeah," says \name{}. "My mom had to leave when I was little. No more than five."

    "What happened?"

    "Debts my dad accrued during the Wail, before he died," says \name{}. "A potion dealer turned warlord sent a few thugs to collect. We didn't have anywhere near enough money. But according to Nana, Mom had known one of the guy's rivals, back when Bonda was still a 
    city. She
    was beautiful too, early forties, still fit. Grew up pampered, so she'd aged better than the whores, beggars, and thugs the guy was used to. So she basically, well, she, she sold herself. To pay
    the debts. To be an advisor to the warlord, and well, you know. Few years later, when Maria and Catalin came of age, they went to find her. That was about ten years ago, now."

    "Sorry."

    \name{} shrugs. "Whose taking care of your siblings now?"

    Alondra doesn't speak immediately. "Younger sister. I'm the oldest. Second oldest is Belicia. She's looking after them."

    "What are the others' names?"

    "Don't want to talk about it." Alondra pulls the hairbrush away, and gets off the bed. "Did what I could. Hopefully your hair's in better shape than it was."

    "Sorry," says \name{}. \HeShe{} runs \hisher{} fingers through \hisher{} \phairlength{newly flattened}{tangle-free}{tangle-free}{tangle-free} hair. "Much better. Not sure how long it'll stay that way."

    "Maybe if you stopped playing with it quite so much, it wouldn't always be such a mess," says Alondra with a smile.

    "Never."

    "Alondra!" bellows Ildri. "Where in the Grand Sands are you?"

    "Coming!" calls Alondra. She gives \name{} another smile. "See you in a few."

    Alondra hurries out, while \name{} gets ready for the day.

\end{childnode}

    "Party pooper," says Alondra. She tosses the hairbrush onto \names{} bed. "Have fun. Put it back on the nightstand when you're done, alright? I'm heading for the kitchen."

    As Alondra leaves, \name{} picks up the hairbrush and gets to work on \hisher{} mess of hair. Then, \heshe{} gets changed. Next step, breakfast.

    \stageDirections{\name{} enters the guild late at night, after another fruitless night trying to track down the Vengadores in general, and Catalin in particular.}

    \name{} pushes aside the thick, hanging blanket that serves as a makeshift door to the guild. The guild is even darker than the midnight streets, the three quarters moon too high in the sky to 
    shine very much of its silvery light 
    through the 
    windows. \name{} snaps \hisher{} fingers, and a small, dim globe of light comes to life in the air above \hisher{} palm. A flick of the fingers, and it sails into the air, and comes to a hover above and slightly behind \hisher{} right shoulder.

    Another night of people hemming and hawing, and not saying anything. Another night of being chased through alleys because some punks figure \names{} a Vengador sympathizer, and
    they'll get a few matrons, maybe even a free potion or two, for handing \himher{} over to Tristana's goons. 
    And \heshe{}'s got nothing. \HeShe{} is no closer to finding Cat, or even a damned Vengador, than when \heshe{} first arrived in this wretched city.
    \name{} collapses into the nearest chair, and slams \hisher{} fist into the table. The table wobbles, one of legs snaps, and the whole thing comes down on \hisher{} thighs.

    \name{} bolts to \hisher{} feet. She grabs the edge of the table and upends it with a crash. \HeShe{} starts kicking one of the table's undamaged legs. "Stupid motherfu-"

    A large ball of bright light flies into the room, nearly blinding the young Taironan. \HeShe{} shields \hisher{} eyes, with one hand, while \hisher{} other goes for \hisher{} \weapon{}.

    "Oh. It's just you. What do you think you're doing?" The light winks out.
    Ildri is standing in the doorway into the back of the guild, her hands on her hips. Several adventurers are standing in the holes in the wall between the kitchen and lobby. Each one is armed.

    "Nothing," grouses \name{}, giving the table another kick.

    "Hey, be careful," says one of the adventurers, a weathered, moderately broad-shouldered man. He hurries over to study the table. "Do you have any idea how long I- Mother's tits! You broke the leg! I spent hours fixing that thing."

    "Well, then you suck at fixing things," says \name{}, giving a leg another kick. "It broke as soon as I put weight on it."

    "That's because the glue wasn't done setting you miserable little-"

    "Ron, that's enough," says Ildri, hastening forward, as if afraid that Ron is going to attack \name{}. Though the way he's gripping his sword, he very well might. "We'll fix it tomorrow. Not a big deal."

    "You better believe it's a big deal. I spent the entire afternoon on that wretched thing," says Ron, passing his glare between \name{} and Ildri. 

    "Well then next time make a sign," says \name{}.

    "I did." Ron crouches and picks up a pair of wooden scraps that had been tied together into a rough X. He shakes it at \name{}. "See this? You were paying attention when Adrian told us how to mark tables and chairs that shouldn't be sat on, right? Or were
    you too busy quaffing a potion, you mud-"

    "Ron!" Ildri smacks Ron's backside. "Go to bed."

    "No," says \name{} quietly, tightening \hisher{} grip on \hisher{} weapon. "Let him finish. I could use a fight."

    "Ron. Go to bed," says Ildri again.

    Ron spins to glare at Ildri. He points a finger at \name{}. "I'm not fixing this cursed table again. \HeShe{} is."

    "Fine. Now go to bed," says Ildri. She matches Ron glare for glare.

    Ron throws one last nasty look at \name{}. He tosses the X at \names{} feet, spits on it, then stomps off, grumbling and cursing under his breath.

    "The rest of you go off to bed," says Ildri, looking at the other adventurers. "We'll have a lot to do tomorrow. Slightly more than we expected."

    No one needs to be told twice.

    As soon as the others have left, Ildri grabs \names{} forearm, spins \himher{} around, and lands two hard smacks to the seat of \hisher{} \trousers{}. "What the hell do you think you're doing? 
    This place is enough of a mess already without you throwing a 
    tantrum."

    "Not my fault Ron sucks at-oww!"

    Ildri gives \name{} another few swats. 

    "Look, just leave me alone alright? I've had a bad day," says \name{}, tugging on \hisher{} arm. "I don't need you spanking me too, you overbearing-"

    "You do not want to finish that sentence," says Ildri, landing another swat on \names{} warming bottom.

    Ildri's eyes widen, and her jaw clenches. "You did not just kick me."

    "What are you senile, you ugly old hag?" says \name{}, rearing \hisher{} foot back to give Ildri another kick.

    Ildri bends over and slams her shoulder into \names{} gut. Her thick arms wrap around \names{} waist, and she lifts the \pbodytype{petite \boygirl{} into the air}{smaller

    \name{} shrieks louder.

    "Stop that carrying on, or you're going to wake the whole guild. Again." Ildri's hand beats a continuous tattoo against \names{} bouncing cheeks. 

    "If you don't stop spanking, I'll just shriek louder," says \name{}, squirming around on Ildri's broad shoulder.

    "Fine. Then I'll just give you a bare bottom spanking in front of the entire guild. Then, once your cheeks are nice and rosy, I'll bend you over a table and let 
    everyone give you three swats with the implement of their choice."

    \name{} stops squirming. "You wouldn't."

    "Try me." Ildri swats \names{} right sitspot.

    \name{} glares at Ildri's heels, but doesn't say anything.

    "Good." Ildri carries \name{} back to \names{} room, swatting the young Taironan's naked bottom the entire way. Once they reach the room, Ildri dumps \name{} on 
    \names{} bed. "Get some sleep. We'll discuss your gross immaturity in the morning."

    \name{} curls up on the bed and rubs \hisher{} cheeks, glaring at the wall.

    "Good night," says Ildri, stepping out and closing the door behind her.

    "\nickname{}?" asks a quiet voice from the only other occupied bed. Alondra. "Are you alright?"

    "Shut up and leave me alone," mutters \name{}, \hisher{} voice thick with tears.

    "Alright," says Alondra. "Good night."

    It seems like \name{} has only just fallen asleep, when Ildri's stern voice jerks \himher{} awake. "Get up \name{}. Time for your punishment."
            
    \name{} opens \hisher{} eyes. Ildri is standing over the bed, her broad spatula in hand. \name{} crosses \hisher{} arms over \hisher{} chest and scowls at Ildri. 
    "Don't know why we couldn't get this over with last night."

    "It wouldn't have been as effective," says Ildri. She gestures with the spatula. "Now get up."

    "No."

    Ildri nods. "Right then."

    She steps forward and grabs \name{} around the waist. With a heave and a grunt, she lifts \name{} up into the air, and throws \himher{} over her left shoulder.

    "Hey!" cries \name{}, flailing uselessly in Ildri's grip. "What are you doing?"

    Ildri \ppajamatype{undoes the dropseat to \names{} \pajamabottoms{}}{tugs down \names{} \pajamabottoms{}}{flips up \names{} \pajamabottoms{}} and cracks her spatula

    "No! Let go of me," cries \name{}, kicking \hisher{} legs, and pounding \hisher{} fists against Ildri's back. "I'm an adult, I can act however I want."

    "Not in my guild you can't." Ildri walks out of \names{} room, her broad spatula smacking against \names{} exposed bottom with every step. 

    By the time the two reach Ildri's room, \names{} bottom is stinging fiercely, and \hisher{} cries have as much pain as anger in them.

    Ildri dumps the \boygirl{} onto the blankets. \name{} rolls onto \hisher{} hands and knees, and tries to crawl away, but Ildri grabs \hisher{} hips and drags \himher{} towards the edge of the
    bed. The cook puts a firm hand on \names{} back, and pins \himher{} securely to the bed. Then, the spatula begins to rapidly rise and fall, peppering \names{} naked bottom with loud,
    stinging blows. \name{} yowls, and \hisher{} body flops about on the bed. But Ildri's grip is unbreakable, and her aim barely affected by \names{} flailing. At one point during \hisher{} flailing, \names{} fingers close over one of Ildri's
    pillows. The young \manwoman{} wraps \hisher{} arms around the pillow and wails into it.
    Eventually, Ildri stops. Faint steps can be heard moving away from the bed.


    "I know I've got it in here somewhere." Ildri's voice is muffled, as if a thin wall is between the cook and \name{}.

    \name{} turns around, and looks in the direction of the voice. Ildri is half-buried in a large, ornate closet, ruffling through various sets of clothing.

    \HeShe{} yelps, and tries to jump back to \hisher{} feet, clutching at \hisher{} very tender tushy. However, heavy wooden benches don't move very well. So instead of jumping to \hisher{} feet, \name{} instead slams \hisher{} knees into the bottom of \hisher{}

    spills \hisher{} morning beer all over the table, trips backward over the bench, and lands flat on \hisher{} back.

    \name{} unleashes every curse \heshe{} knows in Carnuitan and Taironan both. \HeShe{} even makes up a few on the spot.

    "Oh, that's no fun," says Alondra. She flashes \name{} a smile, and pats \himher{} on the shoulder. "Day can't get any worse. Just sit down and have some breakfast. I'll get you another mug."

    Alondra sweeps up the mug, and hurries back to the spigoted barrel.

    \name{} grumbles darkly to \himselfherself{}, but sits down very very gingerly. Then, \heshe{} breaks \hisher{} bread, and starts spreading some of the eggs over it, still grumbling and muttering. Alondra returns and plops a new mug in front of \name{}, 
    flashes \himher{} another smile, then hurries off to help Ildri. \names{} grumbling fades, and a faint warmth spreads through \hisher{} chest.

    Though \name{} tries to eat fast, \heshe{} is only halfway through \hisher{} breakfast when adventurers start pouring in. A few see \himher{} and give a whoop of laughter.

    \name{} blushes. \HeShe{} grabs \hisher{} mug and takes a deep gulp. 

    "Aww, look at that," says a deep voice in a syrupy sweet tone. "Someone's misplaced their kid. Don't worry little \isfemale{lady}{fella}. I can get you a \isfemale{dolly}{wooden sword} if you're scared."

    \name{} glances up to see a towering mountain of a man, six and a half feet tall, and well over 200 lbs, the vast majority of it muscle. He is carrying two plates full of food: eggs, bread, a 
    few slabs of sausage. Standing next to him is a rather short, slender
    man. Or at least, he looks short. Hard to tell next to the man-mountain.

    \name{} scowls, and turns \hisher{} attention back to \hisher{} food. "Go away."

    "Aww, don't mind him," says the shorter guy, sitting down. "He wasn't here two days before Ildri had him tottering around in a pair of those blue short shorts and matching vest."

    "Aaron," says the larger man, aghast.

    "Hey, no fair mocking someone who doesn't know your history," says Aaron, taking a swig of his drink.

    \name{} raises an eyebrow, and looks between Mr. Mountain, and Ildri's distant figure. 

    "Yeah, yeah I know what you're thinking," says Aaron. "How on earth does a big guy like Mike here get forced into a pair of shorts and a vest? Turns out, it's with amazing ease."

    "Aaron..." says Mike, his face turning red.

    "Hush you I'm in the middle of a story," says Aaron. "So anyway, here's Mike. It's his second day, and he doesn't take kindly to Ildri, a freakin' cook, telling him what to do. So he throws a tantrum--"

    "It wasn't--"

    "It was totally a tantrum." Aaron shoots Mike a sharp look, clearly telling Mike to be quiet and let him finish. Mike closes his mouth, and slides onto the bench next to his friend, his face turning redder with every word. "Anyway, where was I? Oh,
    yes. So he's throwing this tantrum, culminating in an attempt to punch Ildri. Well, he's barely started swinging, before Ildri's sitting on one of these benches, with this guy sprawled across her lap. His trousers are around his ankles and he's yelping like
    a virgin-bottomed eighteen year old, while Ildri goes to town on his ass with that spatula."

    "I'm telling you, that thing's enchanted," says Mike, shooting a wary look at Ildri.

    \name{} squirms a little. \HeShe{} wasn't about to argue that!

    "Then, she drags him off by his ear. Few minutes later, in he comes, his face redder than blood. He is dressed in the smallest, sexiest damned shorts I ever did see."

    "Aaron!" cries Mike.

    \cond{'lesbian\_in\_denial'}{\name{} chokes on \hisher{} drink.}{\name{} can't quite deny a little smirk.}

    "Took him to my favorite tavern a few days later. Been together ever since." Aaron winks at \name{}. "Total submissive too. You wouldn't think it from looking at him, but he likes nothing more than for me to make him--"

    "Aaron, come on stop," says Mike, his face so flushed it's a wonder it hasn't spontaneously combusted. "That's none of \hisher{} business. Doubt \heshe{} even wants to know about it."

    "Remember, when we first got together? How you always whined about the others mocking you? How humiliating it was?" asks Aaron, turning to his large companion.

    "I guess..." mumbles Mike. The man seems to deflate.

    "And yet, at the first opportunity, you mock someone in the exact same situation," says Aaron.

    Mike fiddles with some of his eggs. "Sorry."

    Aaron grunts. "Finish your breakfast. We'll finish this talk in private."

    "Interesting. Well, thanks for the story, but I really should be going," says \name{}. \HeShe{} finishes \hisher{} own breakfast, and walks to the door as fast as \heshe{} can without appearing 
    to bolt. A few jeers and mocking comments from dining adventurers assaults \hisher{} 
    ears, but not as much as \heshe{} feared. 

    Soon, \heshe{} is back in the sanctuary of \hisher{} room, free to change out of this childish outfit, and into \hisher{} proper clothing. Assuming \heshe{} wants to.

    \name{} growls in frustration, and slips out from underneath the table, gently easing it to the ground. A quick inspection shows that one of the legs had come loose. Apparently, it'd been repaired and glued back on, but the glue hadn't set yet. There should

    Instead, \heshe{} heads for the kitchen, and the liquor cabinet. 

    "Finally, back huh?" says a voice from the kitchen door.

    Ildri gently shoos \name{} to the side and reopens the cabinet. She pulls out a bottle of white whine.

    Ildri pours a couple of mugs, and plops them down on the counter. "Sit down."

    \name{} slips into the seat next to Ildri, and takes the cup. \HeShe{} takes a drink, and sighs as the sweet liquid flows down \hisher{} throat. Is it the kind of drink to put hair on your chest? No. But \name{} finds \himselfherself{} too tired for anything more intense.

    "No luck finding Cat, I assume?" says Ildri right before taking a sip of her own drink.

    \name{} fiddles with \hisher{} mug. "Yeah. Jerk shows up in the middle of the night completely uninvited, makes a few snide remarks, and then runs off. Doesn't give me an address or anything. Doesn't even give me some inane riddle that I'll solve when I'm
    finally ready to see her, or some such garbage."

    "To be fair, she did have the law snarling at her heels," says Ildri. There is a faint hesitation in her voice, and she shifts a little in her seat. "About that--"

    \name{} flicks \hisher{} wrist in dismissal. "Not much you can do about it. Besides, it's not like the Vengadores have done much to get on your good side."

    "That's true," says Ildri, staring into her drink. 

    "Girl's had a month, though," says \name{}. "She could have, I don't know, ambushed me in an alley or something. Dropped off a letter in the middle of the night. Something. An apology for bringing the guards down on my head, or for her friends 
    stabbing me, burning me, \cond{'spanked\_by\_Necia' in pwutilities.keywords() or 'spanked\_by\_Necia\_with\_sandal' in pwutilities.keywords()}{spanking me."}{throwing me all over the 
    guild."}

    "Well, if it makes you feel any better, girl was just as incorrigible when she worked for us," says Ildri. She smiles fondly. "Her and Maria were quite the pair. Practically drove me to drinking. Was just about to buy a new paddle all for them, with holes
    and everything, when the riots happened."

    Ildri's smile fades. "Cat and Maria vanished after that. Maria showed up again about six months later, but... well... She moved out. Only shows up once a week or so, to see if Adrian's got a job 
    for her. Sometimes not even that often."

    \name{} grunts. Ildri takes another drink.

    "What's with these riots I keep hearing about?" asks \name{}.

    Ildri shrugs. "Before Roland took over, the city guard was run by this rotten son of a bitch, Lord Alfred Redstar. Under him, the guards were more rotten than a dead tree. You think the Taironans have it bad now? You guys had it worse then. Guards only gave a 
    damn about people who could throw them a few extra matrons, and most Taironans
    don't have enough to feed themselves, let alone bribe city officials. 
    
    "Except Tristana. She had enough to bribe the guard to look the other way, a few of the more corrupt ones even slipped her some weapons from the city armory. Started to set up shop in the
    slums, selling potions, creating her own police force. A few other warlord wanna-bes tried to challenge her, but a few matrons to the guards got them hauled off to some dank hole somewhere. So she quickly takes over the slums, starts doing terrible things to 
    consolidate her power, and the guards don't pay any attention. So, people get pissed.
    
    "A woman named Sofia manages to convince people to join her in mass protests. You know, blocking streets, blocking off the main route into the city, that sort of thing. Neither 
    Tristana nor the city guard are having any of it, and both take rather brutal measures to shut it down. Doesn't take much for the protests to devolve into riots. In the aftermath, Lady Amelia Silverstone managed to get Redstar replaced with her son, Roland.
    Guy's been working his ass off since then to clean up the guards. Now they're only as rotten as a dying tree. Doesn't like us much, though. Doesn't like how we skirt about the gray edges of the 
    law, and all that. Adrian isn't too happy about that. Like everyone else with money, Adrian had a very comfortable relationship with Redstar."

    "I see," says \name{}. \HeShe{} takes another drink. "And Maria and Cat got caught up in all that?"
   
    Ildri nods. "I don't suppose you've seen her in the past month, have you? Maria, I mean."

    \cond{'grudge\_against\_Maria'}{"Hell no," says \name{}. \HeShe{} takes a long, deep drink. "Want nothing to do with her."}{"I've visited her a few times. Doesn't talk much. Just asks how I'm doing. Refuses to say anything about Cat."}

    \cond{'grudge\_against\_Maria'}{"I don't want to talk about it," says \name{}.}{"I will," says \name{}.} \name{} finishes \hisher{} drink.

    "Alright, well you should probbaly get to bed," says Ildri. "A lot to do tomorrow. And don't tell Adrian I said this, but he's finishing up negotiations for a job that he thinks'll be right up your alley."

    \name{} grins, and perks up. "Really?"

    Ildri chuckles. "Thought that might cheer you up a bit. Now get to bed. Don't want to be nodding off while he's briefing you. He doesn't like that. I'll clean up."

    \name{} hops from \hisher{} seat and leaves, a light swat from Ildri speeding \himher{} on \hisher{} way.

    A few minutes later, \heshe{} is in \hisher{} pajamas, in bed, and trying to fall asleep.

    Carrie and \name{} jump. \name{} yanks \hisher{} lips away from Carrie's body. \HisHer{} hands fly to cover \hisher{} more sensitive bits, while Carrie wraps the blankets around her mostly naked body. 

    "Nothing," says \name{} quickly, fishing about for \hisher{} \isfemale{dress}{pants}. Finally, \heshe{} gives up and wraps a bit of blanket around \himselfherself{}. "Just, you know. Getting ready for bed."

    "Since when did 'getting ready for bed' involve stripping and kissing?" asks Maria, her silouette rising from her blankets.

    "Oh yes, Cat threw her lot in with a gang because of some spat with an old friend," says Maria. She stands, advances on \name{}, and grabs \hisher{} ear in a twisting pinch. "You want to be nasty? Next time try something a bit less ridiculous."

    "Oh yea-agh!"

    Maria yanks \name{} forward onto \hisher{} hands and knees. Then, Maria kneels and hooks her arm around \names{} waist. \name{} tries to throw Maria off, but Maria drops her hairbrush and thwacks the inside of each of \names{}
    elbows hard enough to make \hisher{} arms buckle. Then, Maria yanks \names{} arms out from underneath \himher{}, and pins them against \hisher{} back. In less than a second, \names{} face is pressed against the 
    cool dirt floor, with \hisher{} naked butt thrust up in high in the air, fully exposing everything to Maria and Carrie. Maria picks up her trusty hairbrush, and smacks \names{} bottom. 

    \name{} yelps, and squirms. "Prudish harpy! When I get out of this--"

    "You will apologize for being inconsiderate and nasty. Then you will go to bed," says Maria sharply, her hairbrush thwacking painfully against \names{} tense bottom. "Also, I'm not a prude.
    You can have all the sex you want, I don't care. I just don't want to listen to it."

    "Get buried! Oww!" \names{} feet drum against the dirt floor after a particularly hard smack to \hisher{} left sitspot.

    Maria begins a steady, metronome-like spanking. Left, right, left, right over and over again, each blow at the exact same strength, spaced at the exact same time after the previous. With each
    blow, \name{} squirming gets more frantic as the heat in \hisher{} \muscleadj{} bottom builds, and builds, and builds.
    Five minutes later, \name{} is crying, \hisher{} red bottom awash with dark, hairbrush-shaped bruises.

    "Please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I won't do it again, please stop!" says \name{}.

    "Good." Maria gives \name{} one last thwack, then releases \himher{}.

    \name{} crawls away, clutching at \hisher{} throbbing bottom.

    "Your turn Carrie," says Maria, lightly smacking her palm with the hairbrush.

    "Me?" asks Carrie, her voice squeaking. "What did I do?"

    "Can't dance without a partner," says Maria. "You knew full well that \name{} and I live together, and that I'd almost certainly be at home and asleep. And I know you well enough to know it was probably you pushing for some play time, my sleep be damned. Now turn 
    around and stick your butt out, before I make you."
    
    Carrie gnaws on her fingernail for a moment, and glances at the marks mottling \names{} beaten buttocks. Then she sighs, and drops the blankets from her body. She shuffles around on her hands and knees, and sticks her curvy, bouncy bottom at Maria, her 
    G-string hiding almost nothing.
    
    "Good girl," says Maria. She shuffles over to Carrie, and puts her free hand on the small of Carrie's back. The hairbrush arcs through the air and cracks against Carrie's right cheek.

    Carrie yelps softly, her body rocking forward, and her plump bum cheek rippling beneath the blow. "I'm sorry, Maria."

    "You were being very inconsiderate, you know that?" says Maria, drawing the hairbrush back for the second blow. "You and \name{} both."

    The hairbrush crashes into Carrie's left cheek. Carrie yelps and wiggles her bottom back and forth. "I'm sorry, Maria. It won't happen again."

    Maria spanks Carrie for a solid minute, the hairbrush spreading an even pink blush across Carrie's pale, quivering, squirming bottom, with a few darker, oval marks scattered throughout. Carrie apologizes throughout the hairbrushing, her words a little bit more 
    choked with each blow.

    "Alright," says Maria. She rubs Carrie's bottom. "We're done. Now both of you go to bed. We'll work out some regular playtime for you two in the morning."

    Carrie nods, and crawls into \names{} blankets. \name{} joins her. As \heshe{} slips in next to the young blonde, \hisher{} hand starts gently massaging
    and kneading Carrie's bruised bottom. Carrie winces, then sighs as \name{} rubs away the worst of the sting.

    "Thanks," murmurs Carrie. She turns around to face \name{}, and slips her hand behind the Taironan. \HisHer{} hands start massaging \names{} scalding cheeks. She also wipes the tears from \names{} face.

    \names{} sigh of relief mirrors Carrie's.

    "I'm sorry," whispers Carrie. "I should have--"

    "Eh, it's not your fault." A bit of bitterness enters \names{} voice. "It's hers."

    "Um, maybe we should just go to sleep," says Carrie. "I'm sure we'll feel better in the morning."

    "Yeah. I guess we should have." Maria runs a hand through her hair, and considers the two. Carrie picks meekly at her blanket, while \name{} fiddles with the blanket's corner. She tosses the hairbrush back onto the ground next to her blankets. "I guess it's not 
    fair to get 
    mad at you for something we haven't really talked about. Especially since we've lived together for a month, and I still couldn't be bothered to lay down some proper rules. Just go to bed. We'll discuss this in the morning."

    "You're not going to spank us?" asks Carrie, looking up at Maria with wide eyes.

    Maria lies back down. She rolls herself into her blankets, her back to the pair. "Just go to bed, before I change my mind."

    \name{} throws on \hisher{} pajamas, then crawls the blankets with Carrie. "Better do as she says. That hairbrush stings something fierce."

    Carrie squirms against \name{}, her mostly naked bottom rubbing against \names{} crotch.  

    \name{} gives Carrie a playful swat. "Don't do that, or I won't be able to help myself, then we will get spanked."

    "Just getting comfortable," says Carrie, wiggling backwards until her smooth, warm back is pressed against \names{} chest. \name{} wraps \hisher{} arms around her waist, and pulls her tight. \name{} kisses Carrie on the neck, then snuggles into the

    "Can't imagine why," says Maria sardonically. 

    Carrie sticks her tongue out at Maria, then blows \name{} a kiss. "Stop by later today will you? I could use your help with something."

    regains \hisher{} balance, \heshe{} shoves the door closed. 

    "Where have you been?" Maria sits next to the firepit, stoking the embers with a thick stick she affectionately calls her "poking stick." Her eyes skim over \names{} mud-stained boots, and the mud-splatter on \hisher{} legs. "Looks like you've been running."

    "What do you care? You're not Nana," says \name{}, sitting down on \hisher{} blankets.

    Maria doesn't respond immediately. When she does, her voice is soft, hesitant. "You know, I was with Cat all the years she lived in Bonda. You can just ask me about your mother. You could have asked me at any time."

    "Yeah." \names{} anger withers, and is replaced by dread mixed with despair. "I just, I...I don't know. I don't want to hear the answer. But well, did you find out anything?"

    Maria shakes her head. "Nothing. The guy who took your mom? His operation was broken up, and his territory claimed by some other potion lord a few years after your mother left. Then that guy got killed in a coup, and his operation suffered some 
    internal strife. No idea what happened to your mother after that. Maybe she's somewhere on the streets, just another nameless beggar. Maybe she's managed to make something of herself, she was 
    very politically savvy, you know. Maybe she managed to carve out
    her own niche somewhere, admist the chaos."

    "Or maybe she's dead," says \name{}. "That's most likely isn't it? She wasn't taken just for her skill in politics. And she'd be pretty old by now. I mean, not super 
    old or anything. But old enough. Enough to be ugly. To be useless. Not worth feeding. Maybe even a liability. After all, she was old nobility, who tried to flee, and..."

    "I have to find Cat," says \name{} after a few minutes of silence. "She's all the family I have left. I mean, I have you and Nana of course, but---"

    "I know," says Maria. "She's your sister. Of course you want to find her. Just be careful, ok? When we couldn't find your mom, well, it drove Cat a little crazy. The whole 'working as a mercenary in Bonda for five years' didn't help much either. Woman's angry,
    and she doesn't know who to be angry at. So she's angry at everyone."

    "Maybe you could help me--"

    Maria shakes her head. She stares into the embers of the cookfire. "Sorry sweetie. I love your sister, I do. But I don't want anything to do with her. Not anymore. It's too hard."

    \name{} frowns. "What? But you two were inseperable. What happened?"

    "It doesn't matter." Maria extricates herself from \name{} and stands. She wipes her hands on her skirt, and forces a smile. "Just get some sleep, alright? Busy day tomorrow."

    \name{} had heard that tone in Maria's voice often enough growing up to know better than to push it. At best, it'd be a waste of time. At worst it'd lead to a shouting match.

    "Fine." Maria reaches out to grab \name{}.

    \name{} rolls backward, and jumps to \hisher{} feet. \HeShe{} bolts out the backdoor and into the small courtyard they share with a dozen other apartments. The courtyard is lit only by the 
    stars. A single tree sits in the center of the courtyard, a stone 
    bench situated beneath it. 

    "Dammit \name{}, you're only making it worse on yourself," says Maria, chasing after \himher{}.

    \name{} bolts around the tree, and puts the trunk between \himselfherself{} and Maria.

    Maria stops when she reaches the bench. She puts her hands on her hips and glares at \name{}. "I am not going to chase you around that tree. You can't hide behind there forever."

    "You can't wait for me forever," says \name{}. "This is totally unfair. If Nana could see you now, she'd die of shame. Then she'd bring herself back from the dead, spank you silly, and
    die of shame again."

    Maria sighs, and sits down on the stone bench. She swings her feet up onto the bench, and stretches out. She puts her hands behind her head, and lays her head down on the cold stone.

    Time passes. \name{} isn't sure how much. An hour? Maybe two? A few minutes?

    Maria's breath is soft and regular. Her body is relaxed, but occasionally twitches, as if reacting to a dream.

    \name{} gnaws nervously on \hisher{} lip, then glances towards the apartment. If \heshe{} could just slip past Maria...

    Slowly, ever so slowly, \name{} slips around the tree and starts to creep past Maria one slow, careful step at a time. \HeShe{} stops and tenses when \heshe{} gets within armsreach of the older Taironan, but nothing happens. \HeShe{} breathes the smallest sigh of 
    relief, and resumes \hisher{} creeping.
    
    Suddenly, Maria's eyes shoot open. Her body snaps up, her hand lashes out, and she grabs \names{} wrist. "Gotcha brat."

    \name{} yelps, and tries to pull away. "Let go of me!"

    Maria swings to her feet, yanks \name{} towards her, and wraps her arm around \names{} waist. She sits down, hauls \name{} across her knee, 
    \ppjtype{unbuttons \names{} dropseat, and yanks away the flap}{and lowers \names{} \pajamabottoms{} to \hisher{} knees}{and raises \names{} \pajamabottoms{}}, exposing \names{}
    \muscleadj{}, \bumadj{} bare bottom. 
    
    "Let go of me!" cries \name{}, squirming in Maria's lap.

    "No." Maria clamps her left hand over \names{} mouth, and slaps \names{} bottom with her right. 

    \name{} screams against Maria's hand. \HeShe{} tries to bite, but Maria's hand is too thin and gaunt, and the skin too tight. Maria lands half a dozen stinging
    blows to \names{} bare bottom, the sharp slap of hand to flesh echoing throughout the courtyard.
    Then, Maria reaches back and snaps off a whippy branch from the small tree.

    \name{} tries to scramble off of the older Taironan's lap, but Maria wraps her leg over \names{} thighs, and pulls back gently but firmly on \names{} head.

    Maria gives the switch a few test swings. \names{} bottom clenches as the switch whistles through the air mere centimeters above \himher{}. \HisHer{} stomach tightens, and \hisher{} heart
    starts to pound.

    Maria makes a sound of satisfaction. Then, the switch whistles through the air and snaps across the center of \names{} \bumadj{} bottom. \name{} shrieks against Maria's hand, and \hisher{} hips buck. Maria
    administers the switch swiftly and precisely, flicking her wrist right before each blow to add extra sting. \name{} kicks, flails and shrieks through 
    each stroke. Before long, \hisher{} bottom is a throbbing mass of pain. Tears flow freely down \hisher{} face, and \hisher{} body is wracked by sobs.

    Maria sets the switch aside, and gingerly touches \names{} stripes. \name{} tenses, and \hisher{} sobs are punctured by a pained moan. However, as Maria's fingers continue to lightly trace and
    rub \names{} welts, the younger Taironan starts to relax.

    "Now," says Maria. "Are you going to keep looking for Cat?"

    \name{} shakes \hisher{} head frantically.

    "You better not be lying to me. Because I'll give you twice that and then some if you are," says Maria.

    \name{} shakes \hisher{} head again.

    "Alright, then, come on," says Maria. "Stand up."

    \name{} clambers to \hisher{} feet, and clutches the tops of \hisher{} thighs, as close as \heshe{} dare get to \hisher{} throbbing cheeks. \HeShe{} whines, and starts dancing
    about the courtyard.

    "I'm sorry," says Maria, when \name{} finishes dancing. She puts an arm around \names{} shoulders and gives \himher{} a kiss on the forehead. "I know this seems cruel, tyrannical even. But it's for your own good, I promise. Don't make the same mistakes Cat and I 
    did. Please. It's not worth it. It's really, really not worth it." 
        
    \name{} doesn't say anything. \HeShe{} just rubs and sniffs.

    "Alright, now let's get to bed."

    "In a perfect world, I'd be living in Bonda with my family," says \name{} bitterly. \HeShe{} crawls into \hisher{} blankets and pulls the sheets up over \hisher{} head. \HeShe{} rolls onto \hisher{} side, away from Maria.

    "I know." Maria rubs \names{} shoulder. "I'm sorry. But I won't let you make the same mistake Cat and I did. Even if I have to tenderize your bottom a few times to do it."

    "About last night," says Maria.

    "What about it?" asks \name{} warily.

    "I feel like I should explain myself," says Maria. "Why I don't want you chasing after the Vengadores. Besides you know the whole they're criminals thing. Look, before Roland took over the city 
    guard, it was led by this pig named
    Alfred Redstar. Guy was rotten to the core, and all but in Tristana's pocket.
    
    "So, Sofia the woman we'll be visiting today, she starts to organize protests, to bring people's attention to Tristana's iron grip on the slums, and 
    corruption in the city guards. Cat and I, we were fresh from
    Bonda. Didn't want to see history repeat itself. So we joined the protestors. Neither Tristana nor Redstar were too happy about us, so it didn't take long for the brutal crackdowns to start. The protests turned into riots. The riots rocked the city for
    weeks, and Redstar proved completely incapable of handling it. When the dust settled, Redstar was forced to resign in disgrace, and Roland took over. He then proceeded to completely ignore the slums while he cracked down on corruption within the guards. Now,
    the guards are mostly honest, but Tristana's grip on the slums is almost unbreakable. Nothing short of a street war will shake her loose. Those riots, they were bad, \nickname{}, and they started peaceful. I can't imagine how an armed resistence will turn 
    out. I just don't want you caught up in it."

    \name{} shrugs. "I'm not necessarily saying I want to join the Vengadores, or anything. I just want to see my sister." 

    "And I understand that. It's just, it's dangerous. She's at the center of a maelstrom, and I don't want you caught in it."

    \name{} doesn't respond. Maria grimaces, and turns her attention back to the porridge. A few minutes of relative silence pass, while the porridge cooks.

    "Ready to go to Sofia's?" asks Maria. She scoops some porridge out of the cookpot and into a crude wooden bowl, then hands it off to \name{}.  

    "Uh?" says \name{}, taking the bowl, and digging in.

    Maria rolls her eyes. "I swear, you'd forget your name if I didn't use it everyday. We're going to help at the Clinic, remember?"

    "Oh. Right," says \name{}, hunching over \hisher{} bowl.

    "You sound less than enthused," says Maria, taking the cookpot off the flames, and eating her porridge from it directly.

    \name{} shrugs, and shoves a spoonful of the rather bland, but filling porrdige into \hisher{} mouth. "Tired."

    Maria is too consumed with the task of consuming her breakfast to answer.

    After breakfast, \name{} and Maria get changed. 

    "Make sure to bring your weapon," says Maria. "We shouldn't have any problems, but the Clinic is in a rather rough part of the slums, \isfemale{and seeing as we're both women...}{so you know, best be prepared.}

    \isfemale{Right. "Easy" targets. Wonderful.}{Wonderful.}

    "Don't get me wrong, we shouldn't have a problem," says Maria, strapping on her wicked dagger. "Most people have a lot of respect for Sofia, and messing with volunteers at her clinic is not how you make friends. Even Tristana's efforts to find the clinic and shut 
    it down are little more than token 
    efforts to please some of her more militant supporters. But you know, it happens. Plus there's the stray dogs to worry about. Most of them avoid people, but if they get hungry, desperate, or rabid enough..."

    "I get it," says \name{} testily. The thought of slogging through the slums to watch people suffer through withdrawal does not sound particularly appealing. Perhaps \heshe{} should just bolt of the Adventurer's Guild, or something as soon as they step out the 
    door? Maybe if \heshe{} ran fast enough, and talked fast enough, \heshe{} could get out of this whole clinic thing. At least for today.
    
    "Ready to go?" asks Maria.

As \name{} starts out the door, Maria's hand falls onto \hisher{} shoulder.

"Just a moment, \boygirl{}," says Maria firmly. "Where exactly are you headed?"

"Um... I was going to... I was just going to head toward..."

"'To the Clinic' is the only acceptable end to that sentence right now, \nickname{}. I don't like that you're looking for a different one." Maria's voice betrays her disappointment and anger, and \names{} 
stomach sinks, knowing what's likely to come.

"I was... going to go to the Clinic!" says \name{} desperately.

"Sure you were. You just had one or two little things to do first, right? Some date, some pointless fetch quest, maybe stop by the Guild and see if there's a job going, and eventually you'd make your way to the Clinic if you couldn't think of any more 
excuses. But I'm sure your intentions were good, right?"

\name{} blushes and looks at \hisher{} feet. 

"Uh-huh. You're about to get a reminder of just where the road of good intentions leads, but more than that, you're going to get a reminder that as long as you're under my roof, I feel responsible for you. And as long as I'm responsible for you, you are not going to 
be toddling off to hell while telling yourself that you really mean well."

"I get it, I'll go straight to the Clinic--," says Juliana.

"And when you get there, if they ask why you can't sit down, you can tell them that you had trouble remembering to taking your commitments seriously."

Maria sits down, and pulls \name{} across her strong lap in a single practiced motion.

\name{} winces in advance as Maria bares \hisher{} bottom. \HeShe{}'s (mostly) learned better than to resist, but it means that what's coming is going to sting that much worse.

Maria rubs \names{} \bumadj{} bottom with her hand, as though scouting the territory. "We're going to get this over with quickly this time, but if you try to duck out on something like this again, you can think of this as a small sample." With that, she 
brings her hand down sharply in a hard smack, making \name{} yelp quietly.

One spank after another comes down until \names{} bottom is noticeably pink all over. 

"Okay, okay!" says \name{}, squirming. "I get the message!"

"Oh, that wasn't the message," says Maria, picking up her good bone hairbrush. "That was the preamble, the polite introduction to the message. This is the message." 

Sharp, stinging strokes of the brush begin punctuating Maria's words, making \name{} kick and cry out slightly with each blow. "You... will... not... duck... out... on... your... responsibilities... young... \manlady{}." Several hard smacks in quick succession serve 
as punctuation. "When... you... promise... to... do... something... you... will... DO IT!" Several more hard strokes underline the last two words. "Am I making myself clear?"

"Y-yes," says Juliana through gritted teeth.

"What message is getting through to you?"

"That I have to honor my commitments, even... even if they're not fun."

"Good, you're getting the message. And to make sure you get it, you're going to count down from twenty for me."

"No, please, I'll go, you don't have to..."

"Want to go for thirty?"

"Twenty," says Juliana resignedly, then yips as the brush smacks hard against her already-sore left cheek. 

"Nineteen!" she says reflexively, which summons the next smack on her right.

By the time she gets down to one, Juliana's bottom is burning and tingling all over, the sharp sting of the brush fading into a hot soreness that promises to linger for a while. Maria picks her up off her lap and stands, hugging Juliana gently. "I'm sorry I had to do 
that, but if I let you ignore the Clinic once, we both know you'll just do it again whenever you don't feel like going."

Juliana returns the hug with one arm, rubbing her sore bottom with the other hand.

"Right then," says Maria finally. "Off to the Clinic!"

    As \name{} and Maria enter the Clinic, Maria waves to an older Taironan woman. The woman is short and relatively squat, with greying hair that she keeps pulled back into a bun. Her face is heavily lined, especially around her eyes and forehead, and there are 
    deep bags under her eyes. The woman looks to be in her sixties, but considering the hard life she's likely led, she could very easily be younger. 

    She smiles brightly as she approaches \name{} and Maria. She pulls Maria into a hug and gives her a kiss on the cheek. "Maria. How are you? City guard hasn't been hassling you too badly, I hope, what with Catalin and her band of outlaws."

    Maria returns the kiss and the smile. "They asked me a few questions of course, but nothing more than that. Knocked down my door last month, but I think I told you about that, didn't I?"

    "Indeed." Sofia turns her smile on \name{}, and pulls \himher{} into a hug and a kiss. "Because this one is unfortunate enough to be Catalin's \brothersister{}. Hello, \name{}. I am Sofia. A humble healer."

    Maria grunts. "Healer? Maybe. Humble? Certainly not."

    Sofia playfully swats the side of Maria's thigh. "Respect your elders girl. And don't you know it's rude to interrupt introductions? Kids these days. No manners." 

    Sofia turns her attention back to \name{}. "A pleasure to meet you, \name{}. Maria and Catalin, well before Cat went off the deepend anyway, have both told me so much about you. I almost feel like I know you."

    "A pleasure," says \name{}, smiling politely. \cond{'met\_Paloma' in pwutilities.keywords()}{There's something about Sofia that tickles \names{} memory. Something about her voice, or her mannerisms. Maybe her face.}{}

    "Here to help us, I hope," says Sofia, stepping to the side, and sweeping her arm to indicate the twenty or so men and women lying, sleeping, thrashing, and moaning in ratty blankets. "La Madre knows, we could use it."

    "Umm, yes," says \name{}, glancing briefly at Maria. "How I'm paying for last month's rent."

    Sofia raises an eyebrow, and glances at Maria. "Had to drag \himher{} here kicking and screaming I take it?"

    \cond{'ep2WrongWay' in pwutilities.keywords()}{"Just about,"}{"Actually, \heshe{} came without a fuss,"} says Maria.

    "Well--" begins Sofia.

    "No, let go of me I can't take it anymore!" cries a male voice.

    The trio turn towards the back of the room. A young Taironan man, about \names{} age, perhaps a few years younger, is fighting against a couple of volunteers.

    "I need to get out of here. I need, I need one!" wails the man.

    "Maria," says Sofia, pointing at the struggling man.

    "On it." Maria dances nimbly around the volunteers and patients on her way to the back of the room.

    "Should I help?" asks \name{}, stepping forward.

    Sofia shakes her head. "Sorry, but I don't know you well enough to feel comfortable with you working with the more... rambunctious patients. Nothing against you dear, I just want to make sure you won't accidentally hurt them. People suffering from potion
    withdrawal are much more fragile than you're probably used to. Just go amongst the quieter patients, chat with them a little. See if they need anything."

    "That's it?" asks \name{}, glancing at the various men and women, all in various stages of distress.

    "You'd be surprised what a bit of chitchat can do for a person," says Sofia. She tries to smile, but it doesn't last very long. "And, there's not really much else we can do. The--actually, nevermind."

    \name{} nods, and starts wandering amongst the patients. \HeShe{} settles down next to a rather quiet man who looks to be in his seventies. \name{} can't help but feel a small chill. The old man 
    looks old enough to
    have served in the Goldenwood War, a three way conflict between Vellaunodunum, Bonda, and the Elven tribe Ambarri. What a life. The Goldenwood War, the Wasting Wail, the Potion Riots, now an

    liked it."

    \name{} rolls \hisher{} eyes.

    "Don't you roll your eyes at me \boygirl{}," says the man. His tone is light-hearted, and there's a sparkle of mirth in his eye. "Didn't your mother teach you to respect your elders?"

    "Is that all you old people say?" asks \name{}. "I'll start respecting you when you stop trotting out tired cliches."

    "My father was Senor Gervasio Verdugo Pimentel, and my mother was Senora Ora Silva Josefa de Verdugo," says \name{}. "Did you know them? Are you nobility?"

    The old man laughs. "Not quite. I was the primary stagecoach driver for the Mendoza family. Drove past your family home every time I took the ladies Mendoza to the market, or a ball, or whatever. Still remember the serpentine green dragon
    engraved on a plate in the middle of your home's gates. Thirty years I drove that stagecoach. Thirty years I'd glance through the gates as I drove past. Saw your father practicing his swordfighting, or getting his horse ready for travel. Often saw a 
    young girl playing in the grounds, just before the plague hit. Was that you? No, you look too young. You'd have been an infant then, if your mother wasn't still pregant."

    "Probably my sister," says \name{}. A small smile tugs at \hisher{} lips.

    "Probably." The man's look is distant. "Her clothing was always a muddy mess. Fancy dress, plain trousers, didn't matter. Can't imagine your mother was too pleased."

    "Probably not," says \name{}. "Nana tells me Cat was always driving Mom up the wall."

    "Hmm. I remember one time. Lady Mendoza's sister was visiting. I forget which city she lives in. Been so long. Anyway, she was visiting, and the two got into a bit of a fight. So, Lady Mendoza ordered me to pull over. Couldn't argue over the racket of the
    stagecoach. Plus,
    the street your family lived on was pretty quiet. The Verdugo weren't particularly influential, if I remember right. Neither were the Mendozas. 
    
    "Anyway, the lady probably figured it'd be better to settle the fight there, instead of in the middle of a crowded
    market, with all her friends tittering behind their hands. So, we pulled over next to your family's house, and I spent the time watching the little girl, (Cat you said? Short for Catalin I presume?) play. Your family had a guard just inside the gate. Ceremonial 
    more
    than anything else, every family had one. Good enough fellow. Shared a few drinks with him, bitched to each other about our employers. Anyway, he was standing just inside the gate, trying to look all serious. Said he did that whenever a stagecoach rolled by. 
    Otherwise, some other family might give your father flack for 'undisciplined guards.' Nevermind that standing around twelve hours a day was stupid. Thieves don't care if you're standing or sitting, they care about the big hunk of wood and steel you've got 
    gripped in one fist.
    
    "Anyway, your sister comes running up with a
    little wooden practice dagger. Course in her chubby little hands it was more of a practice sword. Anyway, she starts wacking at his spear, and he tries to ignore her. Though he does start slightly jerking the shaft back and forth, giving her a moving
    target. Then she decides to go for the shins. Madre, the look on his face was priceless. You could tell that a part of him just wanted to kick her clear over the gates. Just about killed myself laughing. Still, he tries to ignore her, but she whacks his other
    shin. So then he decides to hell with looking disciplined, and starts chasing her around the grounds. She took off, shrieking with laughter." Esai's distant look fades, and he shakes his head. "Well, that was a long time ago, and you probably didn't want to hear 
    me drone away like that."

    "I don't know about that," says \name{}. "All anyone talks about is what Bonda's like now. Or during the wail, or during the riots. It's nice to hear a story from before everything collapsed."

    "I suppose." Esai raises one shaking hand and runs it over his bald head. "Didn't know how good I had it. I mean, I knew I had it good. Good, safe job, lovely wife. Four healthy kids. You know, my granddaughter-in-law's expecting. My first 
    great-grandchild. It's why I'm here."

    Esai coughs violently for a moment.

    "Do you need some water?" asks \name{}, as \heshe{} gently grasps the man's spasming shoulders.

    Esai shakes his head. When the coughing fades, he smiles at \himher{}. "Just trying to get away from me eh? Sorry \boygirl{}. Won't get rid of me that easily. Anyway, the first thing my grandkids saw of me was an old man with a potion in one hand. Now, three of 
    them
    are addicts. Not the one whose wife is expecting, thank los Padres. I don't want that for my great-grandkids too. Figure, maybe if they see me, the patron of the family, free of addiction, maybe 
    between me and their parents, they'll know better than to let themselves...
    Madre, it's so hard these days. Kids got no prospects, not here. Have to choose between throwing in with Tristana, abandoning their families to move to some other city, or struggling to scrape together enough food to see themselves through the summer day,
    let alone the winter night. 
    
    "Don't get me wrong, things were hard for a lot of folk before the plague too. But not my family. When I got that stagecoach driver's job I figured, I beat it. My family's secure. Madre, I was 
    wrong. So cursed arrogant. And Madre,
    She struck me down, to teach me some humility, and now my grandkids are paying the price."

    "Oh come on, Madre doesn't work like that," says \name{}, rearranging the old man's blankets.  

    "Not according to the local local Tios and Tias. I don't know," says the old man. "Fate, arrogance, or rotten luck, it doesn't change anything. Granddaughter-in-law's still gonna be hurt. Hurt 
    bad. She's a sweet kid, too. I don't want to see anything happen to 
    her. But her kid's probably gonna be hungry. Even if he survives childhood, he'll grow up angry, get in fights. Maybe throw in with Tristana, or some gang, like those Vengadores."

    "Hey, \name{}, could you help me with something?" calls Maria from across the room.

    \name{} acknowledges the call and turns back to Esai. "I need to go."

    "I know, you're young and busy, and it's selfish of me to take up all your time. Thanks for listening to an old man blabber," says Esai, patting \name{} on the hand. "Hopefully next time you see me, I'll have this kicked, 
    \cond{universal.state.player.risque() < 4}{and I'll be a little bit less pathetic.}{and I'll give you that spanking I promised.}"

    \cond{universal.state.player.risque() < 4}{"You're not pathetic. Pathetically old maybe, but not pathetic," says \name{}.}{"In that case, I hope you don't mind if I pray for a few bumps in your 
    road to recovery," says \name{}, returning Esai's smile.}

    Esai's reedy laughter follows \name{} across the room.

    After a few hours, sometime in early afternoon, Maria stretches, and knuckles her back. "Alright, \name{}, you can get going. Sure Adrian wants you back at the guild. Even if he doesn't have a job for you, he'll probably want you to help with fixing
    things."

    "You're not coming?" asks \name{}.

    Maria shakes her head. "Nah. I'm gonna stay here. You think you can make it back on your own?"

    "No problem," says \name{}, turning to leave. "See you."

Ildri sighs dramatically and shakes her head at Alondra. "Alondra could you answer a question for me?"

"Hmm?" says Alondra, tearing her eyes away from \names{} rather exposed body.

"Could you tell me why I have to give every adventurer at least half a dozen solid thrashings before they start believing my threats?" says Ildri.

"Umm...?" says \name{}.

Alondra makes a big show of tapping her chin thoughtfully. "Maybe because you have to be both stupid and reckless to become an adventurer?"

"Hey!" cries \name{}.

Ildri nods. "Yes I suppose that makes sense."

"What are you--" begins \name{}.

Ildri rounds on \name{}, spins \himher{} around and lands a heavy smack to \names{} 
\cond{universal.state.player.lower\_clothing().baring and universal.state.player.underwear().baring}{bare cheeks.}{barely covered bottom.}

"Oww!" \name{} hops, and tries to scurry away from Ildri's smack, but Ildri holds the Taironan fast.

"What did I tell you?" asks Ildri, her hand repeatedly striking \names{} \quivering{} cheeks. "When the Vengadores attacked and I had you bent over the counter. What did I tell you?"

"I don't know," wails \name{}, hopping and skipping in a vain attempt to avoid Ildri's large hand. "I was kind of busy!"

"Yeah, busy getting spanked for wearing one of the most inappropriate outfits I have ever seen," says Ildri. "An outfit very much like the one you're wearing now! Now what. Did. I. Say?"

"I don't remember, honest," says \name{}. \HeShe{} manages to slip free, and bolts for one of the holes in the kitchen wall.

But then a glowing white cord wraps itself around \names{} waist.

"Oh shi--"

The cord tightens, then snaps back, yanking \name{} into Ildri's arms. The woman then spins \name{} around, picks \himher{} up, and drapes \himher{} over her shoulder, and wraps her arm around
\names{} legs.

"In that case, let me remind you." Ildri starts smacking \names{} \trousers{}-clad, \bumadj{} bottom. "I said that I would sling you over my shoulder and carry you to the tailors. There, I'd buy
you an outfit that actually covers your ass."

\name{} freezes, and \hisher{} heart leaps into \hisher{} throat. "Oh, no. Madre, please no."

"You got nobody to blame but yourself," says Ildri, landing a particularly hard smack to \names{} right sitspot. "I warned you."

"I thought you were kidding!" cries \name{}, kicking and struggling in Ildri's grip.

"I can't even begin to imagine what would make you think that," says Ildri. She grabs her spatula off the counter and begins smacking \names{} \muscleadj{} bum with it.

\name{} shrieks.

Then, Ildri starts walking to the kitchen door.

"No, wait Ildri don't, I'm sorry, it won't happen again," says \name{}, squirming and kicking. "I'll go to the tailors and get a new pair of pants right now, please!"

"Of course you will, because I'm going to take you there," says Ildri, her spatula never slowing.

"No!" \names{} face flushes as they walked out into the main room. Adrian stands behind the main counter doing paperwork. He glances up as Ildri comes out, shakes his head, and returns to
his forms. Various other adventurers stop chatting long enough to watch Ildri walk out, cracking her spatula against \names{} bottom the whole way.

"Hey isn't that the new girl? The Taironan?" mutters one man.

"Looks like it," says a woman as she sharpens a dagger.

Ildri stops in the middle of the main room. She \cond{universal.state.player.lower\_clothing().armorType == items.Dress.armorType or 
universal.state.player.lower\_clothing().armorType == items.Skirt.armorType}{pushes \names{} \trousers{} up over \names{} \pbodytype{narrow}{slim}{wide}{large} hips}{tugs \names{} \trousers{} down
to \names{} knees} and resumes smacking \pisbaring{\names{} exposed cheeks.}{\names{} bottom, \hisher{} thin \underwear{} providing minimal protection.}{\names{} now naked bottom.} \name{}
finds \himselfherself{} stuck between focusing on her backside bonfire and listening in on nearby conversations.

\cond{universal.state.player.numSpankings >= 6}{"I hear \heshe{} can't go more than ten feet without getting \hisher{} bottom smacked."}{"Look at that bottom bounce."}

\cond{universal.state.player.numSpankings >= 6}{"What was \hisher{} name?"}{"Mother, Ildri hits hard. Remind me not to piss her off."}

\cond{universal.state.player.numSpankings >= 6}{"\name{} Tendercheeks I think."}{"Don't worry about that too much. If you just keep your pants on and be polite, you won't have any problems. Oh and
do whatever Ildri tells you to. She won't tell you to do anything ridiculous, don't worry about that."}

"Can we leave now?" asks \name{} in a pained voice.

"I thought you didn't want to go the tailors," says Ildri over the sharp crack of her spatula against \names{} bottom.

"I changed my mind. Can we please get this over with?" asked \name{}, staring at the back of Ildri's heels, wincing and squirming at the horrible sting that suffuses her bottom.

"Young people," says Ildri to the nearest adventurer, a woman in her mid to late thirties, her spatula making \names{} \pisbaring{naked}{barely clad}{naked} cheeks \quiver{}.  "So impatient these 
days. When are they going to learn that sometimes you just need to stop, take a breath, and really let a lesson sink in?"

"It's sunk in, it's sunk in! Let's just go!"

The adventurer shrugs. "My momma always said it took three good thrashings. One to catch your attention. One to teach the lesson. One to drive it home."

Ildri nods. "Sounds about right."

"Come on!" cries \name{}, pounding \hisher{} fist against Ildri's back. "Either get this shit over with, or let me down you fat cow!"

There is a moment of silence, as everyone takes in what \name{} just said. Then a single voice wafts through the air.

\cond{universal.state.player.numSpankings >= 6}{"More like \name{} Tendercheeks of the Numbskull tribe."}{"Yeah, you see that? That right there? Don't do that. Ever."}

"Well, if you insist." Ildri \pwearingunderwear{tugs \names{} \underwear{} down to \hisher{} ankles,}{gives \name{} one last slap,} then 
    walks out the door.

    \pwearingunderwear{"Hey, what are you doing? Leave my \underwearpanties{} up!" cries \name{}}{\name{} starts squirming
    and snarling in Taironan. \HisHer{} snarls are interrupted by a screech when Ildri lands a pair of hard smacks to \hisher{} sensitive thighs.}

    \pwearingunderwear{"Why? I thought you liked showing your ass off," says Ildri as she steps out into the (busy!) street, her spatula continuing its merciless tattoo against \names{} blazing,
    bouncing bottom.}{"I may not speak Taironan, but I've spanked enough of you brats to know foul language when I hear it," says Ildri.}

    \pwearingunderwear{"Not this much!"}{\name{} starts muttering under \hisher{} breath, still in Taironan. Once again, \heshe{} is interrupted by a howl as the spatula slaps 
    \hisher{} thigh.}

    \pwearingunderwear{"Oh. Oops. Oh well, too late now."}{"I can stil hear you."}

    Ildri wades through the streets, her spatula never slowing. \names{} face somehow manages to get even hotter as \heshe{} watches people's necks crane around to watch \hisher{} very very public
    paddling. \HeShe{} squeezes \hisher{} legs tightly together in an attempt to keep as much hidden as possible. Fortunately, Ildri's left arm is wrapped tightly around \names{} legs, keeping them
    pinned tightly together despite their treacherous desire to spread wide open in frantic kicking.

    Soon, they enter Terry's Tailors. Ildri carries \name{} into the store, sets \name{} down, and makes \himher{} sit on a very hard wooden
    bench.
    
    "You stay still, while I find something appropriate for you," says Ildri, before turning her attention to the nearby clothing.

    \name{} crosses \hisher{} arms over \hisher{} chest and pouts. \pheight{Then, \heshe{} takes a look around and realizes where \heshe{} is. "Hey! This is the children's section!"}{\HeShe{} shifts
    on the hard stone bench, and considers making a break for it, but then decides against it. \HeShe{} would only be delaying the inevitable (and making it worse).}{\HeShe{} shifts

    \pheight{"Act like a child, and I'm going to treat you like one," says Ildri, her voice muffled by the dresses. Someone titters. \name{} glares around the store, and sees most of the customers
    watching the two. \names{} face darkens into a black scowl, and for a moment \heshe{} rears up in rage. But then Ildri sticks her head out of the clothing and gives \himher{} a glare. \name{}
deflates. \HeShe{} pulls \hisher{} knees up to \hisher{} chest, and buries \hisher{} face in them. Ildri comes out a moment later with \isfemale{a}{} yellow \isfemale{flowerprint dress}{shirt and 
trousers}.}{Ildri comes out a moment later with \isfemale{a}{} powder blue \isfemale{dress}{shirt and trousers}.}{Ildri comes out a moment later with \isfemale{a}{} powder blue \isfemale{dress}{shirt 
and trousers}.}{Ildri comes out a moment later with \isfemale{a}{} powder blue \isfemale{dress}{shirt and trousers}.}

Ildri then grabs \name{} throws \himher{} back over her shoulder, and carries her to a small cubbies in the back used to change. Naturally, she is paddling \names{} bottom with her spatual the 
whole way. Tittering and gossip follow \name{} back into those wretched cubbies.

"You weren't kidding! Who is that woman?"

"I hear she's one of the owners of the Adventurer's Guild."

"Well, that explains a lot doesn't it? Adventurers are such unruly creatures. And did you see that girl? She was a Taironan! I bet they're twice as hard to handle as a normal adventurer. You ask one
of them to lend you a hand, and they'll spit in your face just because they can."

"So right."    

Ildri set \name{} down and in a flurry of flying of clothing replaced \names{} outfit with her outfit of choice. She steps back, and studies \name{} for a moment. "Perfect! Nice and decent, just
like a good \boygirl{}."

\name{} glares down at the outfit. "I don't wanna wear this."

"Hey, you had your chance," says Ildri. "Next time wear some real clothing."

\name{} kicks at the ground and mumbles something.

"What was that?" says Ildri sharply.

"I said I can't afford real clothing," says \name{} a tiny bit louder.

"I see. Well, I'm sure Terry will be happy to exchange that dress for something you'd prefer." Ildri grabs \names{} ear and drags her back onto the main floor. "Now come on. I need to buy it, and
get on with my day. You've wasted enough of my time."

Ildri drags \name{} back through the store, pays for the dresses then drags \name{} back to the guild. When they enter the kitchen, Ildri spins \name{} around and gives \name{} one last smack. 
"Now get on with your day, and let me get on with mine."

    Crap. Crap crap. Crap crap crap crap. Crap crap. Crap. How could \heshe{} possibly not have any clothing at all that actually covers \hisher{} ass? How??? 

    Ildri's going to beat \hisher{} ass until it glows in the dark. Then \heshe{}'s going to be walking down the street with a freshly spanked bottom hanging out, yelling to all the world 
    "I've been a naughty \boygirl{}!"

    Could have sworn \heshe{} owned a pair of trousers at least. Did \heshe{} sell \hisher{} trousers or something? Why did \heshe{} do that? Why??? 

    Wait. When did \heshe{} do that, and how did Ildri not notice \himher{} wearing ass-baring clothing before?

    Oh. Right. \HeShe{} sold one pair of pants. Then \heshe{} had to scrounge up some money to buy them back when Alondra warned \himher{} that Ildri would spank \himher{} so hard \heshe{}'d skip
    black and go right to blue. Then that pair of trousers got damaged yesterday when they got caught on an exposed nail.

    Ok. Don't panic. No panicking. This is a strictly no panic zone.

    \names{} takes one last desperate look, and lights on three options. The first is the blanket on \hisher{} bed. The second are the ragged remnants of \names{} old trousers, currently hiding 
    beneath
    \hisher{} bed. The third is the small chest where Alondra keeps her spare clothing.

    \child{Just wrap the blanket around yourself, and hope Ildri has mercy.}{ep2 bedsheet}

\begin{childnode}{ep2 bedsheet}{Andrew Russell}

    \name{} pulls \hisher{} blanket off the bed, and wraps it around \hisher{} waist as an impromptu skirt. Half the cursed thing drags across the ground, and \heshe{} can't go more than three
    steps without tripping over it, but it covers \himher{} by golly!

    Holding \hisher{} head high, \name{} marches, trips, and stumbles back into the kitchen, and proudly presents \himselfherself{}.

    Ildri takes one look at \name{}, and bursts out laughing. "Don't tell me, that pair of pants you ruined yesterday were your last pair."

    "It wasn't my fault," mutters \name{}, fidling with \hisher{} "skirt." "I didn't put that nail there."

    Alondra frowns. "Actually, I'm pretty sure-"

    "No!" says \name{} quickly. "I wouldn't have just left it hanging out in pants ripping range. I mean, who would do such a silly thing as pound in a nail before all the wood was in position?"

    "A \manwoman{} with a hammer and a grim determination to make use of it?" says Alondra.

    "Right. Not me," says \name{}.

    Alondra rolls her eyes. "Whatever. You want to borrow one of my skirts?"

    "Is that all you have?" asks \name{}.

    "Don't like trousers," says Alondra. "No airflow. Now come on. Let's get some real clothes on you."

    A bit later, \name{} is dressed in one of Alondra's skirts. \cond{universal.state.player.height == "small"}{While on Alondra, the skirt extends to a little bit past the knees, \name{} is
    shorter, so the skirt goes about halfway down \hisher{} shins.}{}

    skirt extends down to a little past \names{} knees, like it does on Alondra.}{}

    \cond{universal.state.player.height == "tall"}{\name{} is quite a bit taller than Alondra, so the skirt stops
        several centimeters shy of \names{} knees, about two-thirds down \hisher{} thighs.}{Unfortunately, \name{} is much taller than Alondra, so rather than extending to \hisher{} knees, the skirt

    Meanwhile, \cond{universal.state.player.bodyType == "slim"}{\name{} has much slimmer hips than Alondra, so the two had to track down a bit of string to tie around \names{} waist, to keep the skirt from

    \name{} pulls out the knife \heshe{} uses for non-combat activities, and pulls \hisher{} trousers out from underneath the bed. One leg has been split in half, but fortunately, the most important
    part of the pants (the part that covers \hisher{} ass and crotch) are intact.
    \name{} quickly saws off the trouser legs. Unfortunately, the one leg was so badly damaged, that \heshe{} had no choice but to saw off the entire leg, leaving \himher{} with a very short pair 
    of rather ragged shorts. \HeShe{} pulls on the shorts, and gives \himselfherself{} a quick look and feel-over. OK, so the ass is covered (barely). Also, the pants were kind of tight, and cutting
    off the legs doesn't have any impact on tightness. But the ass is covered. So long as \heshe{} doesn't
    bend over. Better make sure to only bend over when Ildri isn't looking.

    Alondra blushes, and her eyes turn back to Ildri. "I don't know what you're talking about."

    "Sure you don't. Anyway, I said \heshe{} could probably borrow a skirt or something from you, yes?" says Ildri.

    Ildri sets \name{} to work on helping place wood panels on one of the holes in the kitchen. After an hour or so, Adrian walks in and looks around.

    "Ah, there you are," he says. He gestures for \name{} to follow him. "Come along. I have a job for you."

    The other adventurers groan and shoot \name{} envious looks.

    "What are you all complaining about?" asks one guy, a mousy fellow in his early thirties. "Don't tell me you'd rather run through an oversized sewer, chasing giant rats?"

    \name{} follows Adrian into his office, a rather spartan affair dominated by a large, plain desk, and an equally large chair behind said desk. \name{} considers joking about 
    overcompensating for something, but then \heshe{} notices two things.
    First, there is a very whippy looking cane hanging on the wall above the oversized chair, suggesting that not-so-subtly needling Adrian about his penis size was less than wise. Second, sitting in one of the (much smaller) chairs in front of the desk is a 
    leggy blonde woman in a beret and elegant black dress.
    
    Deidre the Puppeteer. 

    Then a hole in reality rips open and a brown-haired, blue eyed, long-legged, but rather scrawny guy enters. He'd be completely forgettable if it wasn't for the strange aura of unbridled sexiness that surrounds him. If you're into guys. If you're into girls, then 
    he's 
    actually a brown-haired, blue eyed, long-legged, rather scrawny girl. She'd be completely forgettable if it wasn't for the strange aura of unbridlged sexiness that surrounds her. If you're into both genders then he/she is whichever gender you're most interested 
    in at the moment. If you're also poly, then shit gets really crazy.

    He/She turns to you, and grins broadly. "Thus ends the current content. If this is your first time playing Pandemonium Cycle: The Potion Wars, then thank you for playing through to this moment. If you're a repeat customer, then thank you for coming back for more. 
    It's nice to know that the keyboard thrashing I call writing hasn't completely scared you off. 
    I hope you enjoyed yourself, and went through many tissues if you have a penis. If you have a vagina, then I hope you went through...whatever it is people with vaginas use to aid in their 
    masturbation.
    Lip gloss? I'm pretty sure women use lip gloss for everything. Though I suppose you could be a transgender man,
    in which case you wouldn't have lip gloss. I guess there's no guarantee that all women have lip gloss either. You know, maybe I should just stop talking."
    
    He/She coughs. There is a moment of silence. It is awkward.

    "Oh, there's one last thing. There's some content in this episode that you'll only see if you didn't 
    go to the tavern with Elise and Carrie in the previous episode. Not a whole lot, but there is some, and there will be more."

    The (wo)man waves good-bye, then steps back through the hole in reality. The hole closes with a sharp zippering sound.

    "Trust me, she's a long ways from that," says \name{}. "I only just mastered firebolt a few weeks before leaving Chengue. Even the most basic combat spells are hard to learn." 

    The two enter the backyard. An older man is standing in front of a small deciduous tree, an over-the-top quizzical look on his face: Sebastian, Peter's father. He is as broad shouldered as Peter but nowhere near as muscular. He also has much the 
    same standing pose, and
    facial structure as Peter. At the far end of the backyard is a well with a simple wooden hatch secured to the top to keep Anne from falling in, a small woodshed, and a smaller outhouse. A small stone wall a little bit
    taller than Peter surrounds the yard, likely meant as much to serve as a fire retardant as for privacy.
    
    Sebastian's eyes light up when he sees Peter. "Ah, good, you're here. Maybe you can help me. It seems that your daughter is a master of stealth and I can't seem to find her."

    Faint giggling wafts through the air, apparently from the somewhere inside the tree.

    "Indeed," says Peter, his lips tugging. "Sure you're not just getting deaf in your old age?"

    As soon as Peter speaks \names{} name, there's a high-pitched squeal from the tree, and a five year old girl comes flying out. She slams into \names{} leg, and wraps her little arms around

    It takes two more tries before Anne can touch the talent deep inside her. But she doesn't just lightly touch it, like she had every other time she'd succeeded. This time she grabs it with both hands and holds it tight. The girl practically hums with power. 

    Anne's eyes open, and her eyes have an extra sparkle to them, not jut reflected sunlight, but something much more internal. "Wow..." 

    \name{} grins, remembering well the first time \heshe{} successfully opened \hisher{} mind's eye, and could see not just a tree, but the glowing aura surrounding every leaf, and every twig. When \heshe{} looked at \hisher{} mother, and saw not just a 
    happy, soothing, kind woman, but an enduring, unshakeable aura of light and power. Everything seemed brighter, sharper, more colorful, more alive.

    Anne looks up at \name{} and grins, then looks over at her father, who has hooked some red-hot metal over the spike on the end of the anvil, and is shaping it with careful taps of his hammer. Then the extra sparkle fades from Anne's eyes.

    Anne's face falls. "Aww. I lost it..."

    "That's ok. We'll get it back," says \name{}. "Close your eyes."

    \name{} sings the song five more times, and Anne manages to get her hands on her talent twice more.

    After Anne's second success, while she is still holding onto her talent, \name{} grins, and whispers into her ear. "Ready to play that prank?"

    Anne nods, and a bright grin spreads across her face.

    "Ok, now open your eyes." \name{} opens \hisher{} own mind's eye. "Take a little bit of your talent, and fling it into the air, like you're throwing a pebble."

    Anne's hand draws back, then awkwardly lurches forward. Nothing happens.

    "Try again."

    Anne tries three more times. On the last time, a small spark of talent flows from her fingertips and into the air. \name{} mentally snatches it up, coaxes it into a full blown spark, and flits it through the air.

    "Is that mine?" asks Anne with big wide eyes.

    "Yours and mine," says \name{}. "Most of the power is from you. I just made it a bit bigger, and I'm controlling it. Now, what should we do with it?"

    "Put it down daddy's pants," says Anne with a giggle.

    \name{} \cond{'attractedToPeter' in pwutilities.keywords()}{blushes. "Well, alright."}{grins. "Devious child."}

    The spark zips through the air, and down Peter's trousers.
    
    Peter jumps, and yelps, one hand going back to grab his slightly singed bottom, while he instinctively swings to face whatever was behind him. Unfortunately, he was in the middle of swinging a hunk of red-hot metal from the forge to the anvil when he jumped. 
    His tongs open slightly as he whips around. The man's aura briefly intensifies  as adrenaline surges through him, fueling his muscles with magical strength. The tongs whip through the air, and the red-hot hunk of metal held within them goes flying.

    Right at Anne.

    Anne shrieks, and hunches back against \name{}. \name{} twists, wrapping \hisher{} arms around Anne a fraction of an instant before the red-hot metal strikes. It slams into \names{} forearm, eliciting a scream of pain as it
    burns into \hisher{} skin. The sickly smell of burned flesh fills the air. \names{} arm spasms before the wound closes. The red-hot metal bounces across the dirt, and comes to rest against the slightly raised stone floor of the smithy. 

    Peter drops his tongs, and bolts over at the speed of a charging bull, while his daughter cries at the top of her lungs, and \name{} curses.

    Peter sweeps Anne into his arms. He brushes her hair back and studied her eyes and forehead carefully. "Oh Mother, honey I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Are you ok?"

    "She's fine," says \name{}, shaking the lingering agony from \hisher{} arm. "I managed to block it. She's just scared."

    Peter, finding no signs of damage, closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He pulls his crying girl tight against his chest and rocks. "Thank the Mother."

    \name{} starts to shake, as the adrenaline fades. If \heshe{} had been a split second slower, if it weren't for all the reaction drills Nana put \himher{} through...A child's health doesn't 
    really develop until the preteen years, right about when puberty first
    starts to appear. Anne's face would have been very very badly burned. At best she would have had very painful injuries for a few weeks, and more than a little scarring. At worst she would have lost an eye. 

    "Come on baby, let's go inside," says Peter, carrying his daughter into their home, temporarily leaving \name{} alone.

    \stageDirections{\name{} tries to run away, before Peter gets back. Peter does not take kindly to this.}

    As soon as Peter is out of sight, \name{} scrambles to \hisher{} feet, and bolts for the back of the yard. 

    "Hey!"

    \name{} glances over \hisher{} shoulder to see Peter barreling out of the smithy after \himher{}. 

    "Get back here!"

    \name{} eeps, and turns to run harder. \HeShe{} reaches the wall, and \pheight{jumps onto the top of the well, then leaps up to grab the top of the wall}{jumps onto the top of the well, then leaps up to grab the top of the wall}{leaps up to grab the top of the

    Then a large, rough hand grabs \pdress{the waistband of}{the waistline of}{the waistband of} 
    \names{} \trousers{}. Almost as soon as Peter's fingers close over \names{} clothing the other hand claps against \hisher{} right cheek. For a fraction of an instant, \name{} feels nothing but an impact, \hisher{} hips driven lightly against the wall. Then, the hot pain catches up, and \name{} yelps and kicks. Peter lands another half a dozen hard, heavy blows to \names{} vulnerable bottom, while \name{} squirms and squeals. \cond{'flirting\_spank\_by\_Peter'}{\names{} stomach clenches in

    was a bad idea.}

    "Care to tell me what Anne was babbling about?" asks Peter curtly. "Something about a sparkle and a prank?"

    "Prank?" says \name{}. \HeShe{} laughs, but the laughter is laced with fear. "Umm. I don't--owww!"

    Peter's hand strikes \names{} right cheek. "Don't waste my time."

    "It was just meant to be a little fun," says \name{}, \hisher{} voice rising to a desperate whine. "I didn't think you'd be--"

    "Moving a red-hot hunk of metal from the forge to the anvil? Half my time is spent moving red-hot hunks of metal!" Peter's heavy hand strikes \names{} bottom twice more. "Mother's love \manwoman{}, I assumed you were smart enough not to mess with a blacksmith
    when he's working. Was I wrong in that?"

    \name{} squirms in Peter's grip, but doesn't answer.

    a yelp when Peter's callused hand strikes \names{} bare right cheek.

    "What kind of example do you think you're setting?" asks Peter. He shifts his grip on \names{} waist, and starts cracking his iron-hard palm repeatedly against \names{} left cheek. "Running away like that. What do you think Anne would think if she saw you
    running away? That it's ok to dodge responsibility? That when you mess up, you should run away, rather than accepting the consequences of your actions? Well?"

    "I don't know..." moans \name{}, squirming and pounding \hisher{} toes against the wall as the heat in \hisher{} left cheek builds to match that in \hisher{} right. "I'm sorry!"

    "Not as sorry as you're gonna be." Peter lifts \name{} off the top of the wall, and sets \himher{} down. Then, the burly blacksmith points towards the woodshed. "Into the shed. March."

    \name{} dances in place, \hisher{} hands flying back and rubbing the worst of the sting from \hisher{} throbbing bottom.

    "I said march." Peter grabs \names{} left arm, tugs the hand away, half-spins the Taironan around, and lands two hard blows to \names{} left cheek. \name{} yelps, and dances away from Peter's hand. Peter's grip on \names{} arm tightens, and he starts tugging
    the tender young \manwoman{} towards the shed. "You do not want me to carry you."

    \name{} takes one look at Peter's stern expression, then lowers \hisher{} head. \HeShe{} follows after Peter, \pheight{walking quickly to keep up with the large man's long, angry strides}{walking quickly to keep up with the large man's long, angry strides}

    Peter enters behind \name{}, closing the door behind him, and bathing the two in darkness. "Make light, if you will."

    \name{} creates a small orb of light, and tosses it up into the rafters. The shed feels much smaller on the inside than it looks on the outside; most of it is filled with logs and scraps of wood, likely used by the house for heating and by the forge for charcoal.
    There is however, a rather tall stool situated in front of the door. Hanging on the wall behind the stool are a variety of tools: an axe, a saw, a wide paddle, a leather tawse, a thin wooden cane, a thicker wooden cane, and a coiled leather whip. 
    \names{} eyes latch onto the whip, and \hisher{} legs start to shake.

    "Congratulations," says Peter sardonically. "You're the first person to earn a trip to my woodshed since my ex-wife left."

    \name{} swallows, still staring at the whip. He wouldn't really use that? Would he? For almost disfiguring his daughter, and then running away? "Umm. So this is where you punished-"

    "We would be more precise." Peter reaches past \name{} and removes the thicker of the two canes. \name{} feels a small bit of relief, followed by fresh anxiety.

    Peter flexes the cane, a distant look in his eyes. "This is where Marcela and I came whenever one of us stepped out of line. My parents and grandparents used it for the same purposes."

    \cond{'attractedToPeter' in pwutilities.keywords()}{A small feeling of intimacy worms its way through \names{} chest. Peter had spent many emotional moments here, with his ex-wife. How did Peter spank her? Was he quiet? Scolding? Was he regretful?

        \name{} feels a jolt of fear. Oh Madre, what happens if Peter doesn't
    forgive \himher{}? What if he hates \himher{}? Gives \himher{} a caning, and then stops letting \himher{} teach Anne? Stops talking to \himher{}?}{"Was that ever used?" asks \name{}, pointing at the whip.}

    was for the horses, not his family."}

    \cond{'attractedToPeter' in pwutilities.keywords()}{"Relax," says Peter, patting \name{} on the shoulder. "Anne wasn't hurt, and I'm not going to fire you for doing one stupid thing. No, I'm just going to cane you silly, and plop you in the corner of the

    down on \hisher{} shoulders. Not like there's anything to do about it now, though. Escaping is looking less than possible, and even if \heshe{} did successfully get away, Ildri'd probably drag \himher{} right back over as soon as she found out, spanking 
    \himher{} all the way.}

    \name{} bends over and puts \hisher{} hands on the stool. \HeShe{} locks \hisher{} knees, and thrusts \hisher{} tender, pinkish, \bumadj{} bottom towards Peter. \cond{'attractedToPeter' in pwutilities.keywords()}{\name{} is surprised by a faint

    to force \himselfherself{} to relax.}

    The cane whips through the air and cuts into \names{} sitspots.

    \name{} shrieks. \HisHer{} fingers dig into the wooden stool, while \hisher{} hips rock forward, and \hisher{} feet dance while a deep line of stinging fire burns through \hisher{} bobbing 
    bottom.

    "What were you thinking?" asks Peter. "Did it ever cross your mind that Anne could have been hurt?"

    "I, I was just trying to, I don't know, offer her a deal. 'Do what you're supposed to, and we'll have some fun,'" says \name{}, \hisher{} voice thickening.

    The cane whishes and thwips again. Again \name{} shrieks, and again \hisher{} hips buck forward, as another line of fire burns its away across \names{} cheeks, a few inches above the previous stripe.

    "Did Anne tell you that she isn't to play with me while I'm working?" asks Peter.

    "Yes," says \name{}.

    "And you insisted anyway?" The cane goes up, whips down and digs into the middle of \names{} bottom, right at the peak of her swelling globes.

    \name{} throws \hisher{} head back and howls. \HeShe{} stomps \hisher{} feet, and a few tears start to trace down \hisher{} cheek.

    "Y-yes," says \name{} between pants. "I'm sorry, I was stupid--"

    "Yes. Yes you were," says Peter. "Very stupid, and very dangerous."

    "I won't do it again," says \name{}, \hisher{} body starting to shudder.

    "No. No you won't." Peter raises the cane.

    Twice more the cane cuts into \names{} bottom, each stroke punctuated by a howl and a sob. \name{} is left with six parallel lines of agony, overlaid on top of an even blanket of soreness. Each stripe is a few inches apart and ranging from the very top of 
    \hisher{} cheeks to the very bottom.

    "It's over." \cond{'attractedToPeter' in pwutilities.keywords()}{Peter sets the cane back in its hooks on the wall, and gently pries \names{} fingers off the stool. Then, to \names{} surprise, he sits down on the stool, his legs open, and guides

    Sebastian come out to speak with Peter, and \name{} tenses, expecting some nasty remark, or scolding for endagering the man's only grandchild. However, Sebastian never says anything to \name{}. He merely exchanges a few quiet words with Peter before returning
    to man the storefront. This doesn't keep \name{} from blushing furiously, and squeezing \hisher{} legs even tighter together.

    "Mother's curse \manwoman{}, I haven't even started spanking you yet," says Peter, his voice soft.

    Peter catches \himher{} around the arm in an iron grip. "Where do you think you're going? If you think you can escape the spanking of your life--"

    \name{} shakes \hisher{} head, but doesn't try to pull away. \HeShe{} just hangs, letting Peter's hold support \himher{}.

    "Come on. Let's get your thrashing over with." Peter guides \name{} towards the small woodshed situated at the back of the yard.

    Once inside, \names{} eyes flick over the sawdust covered piles of wood that dominate the shed. Just inside is a rather tall stool that's just large enough for Peter to sit comfortably on. Hanging on the wall above it are a variety of implements. There's a cane, 
    a paddle,
    a rather short tawse, even a whip. \names{} eyes widen when \heshe{} sees the whip.

    "Grandpa used to have a few horses. The whip was for them," says Peter. He sidles past \name{} and sits down on the stool. He pats

    lap, with Peter's callused hand pressing against \hisher{} soft bottom.

    Peter's hand leaves \names{} bottom. His grip on \names{} back tightens. Then, his hand arcs through the air and strikes \hisher{} naked cheeks. A resounding crack echoes through the shack and 
    \name{} gasps. Not only was the blow loud, but it stung something fierce,

    \names{} exposed cheeks repeatedly and without mercy.

    his left knee, then swings his right leg over \names{} quivering thighs, holding \himher{} pinned. A tingle races through \names{} body, centered on \hisher{} \isfemale{pussy}{penis} at the intimate contact, despite the growing inferno in \hisher{} bottom.

    Then Peter shifts \names{} sandle from his left hand to his right. He slaps the hard leather sole against \names{} left cheek, and all thoughts of intimacy are chased from \names{} mind by the blaze of pain.  Peter applies the sandal with the same merciless
    strength he applied his hand, leaving \name{} to buck and squeal. \HisHer{} cries and the sharp thwack of leather on bare flesh intermingle into an all-consuming cacophany, and \names{} world narrows to the inferno spreading across \hisher{} cheeks, and the 
    harsh sounds seeming to batter \himher{} from all directions.
    
    "I'm sorry!" cries \name{} at last, the words finally dislodged by the pain and helplessness. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so su-sorry!"

    Peter lands another half a dozen stinging slaps, then tosses the sandal onto the ground. He rubs the worst of the sting from \names{} bottom. "You're forgiven."

    Peter awkwardly pulls his large leg off of \names{} thighs, and slips it back underneath them. His large hand gently massages \names{} flaming cheeks, while his other rubs small circles on \names{} back. At first, \name{} just lies across Peter's knee and 
    cries. Eventually, as \heshe{} calms down, \heshe{} becomes more and more aware of \hisher{} hips pressed against Peter's large, solid, warm legs, and of his gentle hands massaging \hisher{} 
    sensitive cheeks and back. \name{} rocks \hisher{} hips a little, as a
    different kind of warmth spreads through \hisher{} body.

    "Alright," says Peter, patting \name{} lightly on the bottom. "Let's get you up. Day's not getting any younger."

    \name{} pouts, but lets Peter help \himher{} clamber off of the blacksmith's lap. 

    "Get yourself decent again, \cond{universal.state.player.risque >= 4}{well, mostly decent anyway,}{and then we'll go,}" says Peter. He shakes a finger at \name{}. "And don't go thinking that I've fired you, or that you can quit over some foolish guilt trip.
    You did something stupid, you got punished, it's over. If you're not here bright and early tomorrow to continue Anne's training I will smack your bottom again, and this time it won't be in the 
    privacy of the woodshed."

    "Yes sir," says \name{}, feeling more warmth in the pit of \hisher{} stomach. \HeShe{} wipes the tears from \hisher{} face and gets changed.

    As the two return to the forge, they find Sebastian and another man, a fairly short Carnutian man, waiting for them.

    "Peter," says Sebastian. "Dan's here to see you."

    "Come on," says Peter, gesturing for \name{} to follow him. "Let's take this someplace more private."

    \name{} follows Peter to a small woodshed set at the back of the property. Most of the woodshed is taken up by piles of wood, some likely used to heat the home, others to provide charcoal for the forge. However, just inside the door is a small stool. On
    the wall above the stool are a variety of implements, including a cane, a paddle, and a whip. \names{} eyes widen when \heshe{} sees the whip.

    "Grandpa used to have a few horses. The whip as for them," says Peter. He sidles past \name{} and sits down on the stool. He pats his knee. "Now come here and lay

\begin{childnode}{ep2 anne play}{Andrew Russell}

    After Anne's second success, while she is still holding onto her magic, \name{} grins, and whispers into her ear. "Ready to play?"

    Anne nods, and a bright grin spreads across her face.

    "Ok, now open your eyes." \name{} opens \hisher{} own mind's eye. "Take a little bit of your magic, and fling it into the air, like you're throwing a pebble."

    Anne's hand draws back, then awkwardly lurches forward. Nothing happens.

    "Try again."

    Anne tries three more times. On the last time, a small spark of magic flows from her fingertips and into the air. \name{} mentally snatches it up, and coaxes it into a full blown spark, and flits it through the air.

    "Is that mine?" asks Anne with big wide eyes.

    "Yours and mine," says \name{}. "Most of the power is from you. I just made it a bit bigger, and I'm controlling it. Now, what should we do with it?"

    Anne frowns. \name{} feels a gentle tug on the sparkle, but doesn't fight it. The sparkle jerks a little to the left, then to the right.

    "Wow," says Anne.

    \name{} conjures three more sparkles, one red, one green, and one blue, and sends them dancing around Anne's white sparkle like faeries dancing in a forest glen. Anne laughs, and claps her hands 
    together. Her sparkle flickers and starts to fade as Anne loses her
    concentration, but \name{} snatches it up, and sends it dancing with the other two.

    "Can I try?" asks Anne.

    "Of course," says \name{}. \HeShe{} puts \hisher{} fingertips against the sides of Anne's head, and concentrates. Small tendrils of magic slip into little girl's mind, giving Anne a connection 
    to the tiniest sliver of \names{} talent.

    The sparkles start to dance chaotically about the courtyard, starting and stopping randomly as Anne's attention shifts awkwardly from one to another, like a novice harpist trying to keep track of both hands at once.

    "Your turn!" Anne jumps out of \names{} lap and runs off to chase the sparkles.

    \name{} sends them dancing around Anne's head, zipping between her fingers, past her ears, and skipping across her forearm. 
    
    The girl squeals happily, and pulls her forearm tight against her body. "That tickles!"

    "Better not let them touch you then," says \name{}, sending the sparkles zooming for Anne.

    Anne laughs, and starts racing around the yard, ducking and dodging the flitting sparkles, squealing every time one manages to touch her.

    Eventually, her running slows. \isfemale{She walks over to \name{}, and flops into \hisher{} lap.}{\name{} extinguishes the sparkles.}

    It isn't long before Anne has fallen asleep.

    "Didn't think she'd played that hard," says Peter, his voice pitched low to keep from waking her. Anne stirs a little at the sound of his voice, but doesn't awaken.

    "Magic's exhausting." \name{} lightly traces \hisher{} fingers down Anne's cheek, just like \hisher{} own mother had done with \himher{}. "Even something as simple as touching your talent can be hard for a girl Anne's age."

    "Hmm." Peter sits down next to \name{}, his eyes never leaving his child. 

    "Shouldn't you be working?" asks \name{}.

    "I needed a break," says Peter. 

    The two sit in silence for a moment.

    "So that song you were singing," says Peter.

    \name{} blushes. "Sounded pretty terrible didn't I?"

    "Well, court musician isn't exactly in your future," says Peter, casting a careful look at \name{}. "But it was still nice. What was it about?"

    "Thought it'd be obvious," says \name{}. \HeShe{} shifts a little to keep \hisher{} legs from falling asleep.

    "You were singing in Taironan," says Peter. "I've picked up a few words here and there: 'hola,' 'papa,' 'mama.' Not enough to understand a song."

    "Right, sorry. It's about a little boy and girl, brother and sister. Their father's vanished, so they go in search of him," says \name{}. "The verses are about the adventures they have trying to 
    find him, while the chorus is about him. His
    warmth, his dependability, his anger, his love."

    "Do they find him?" asks Peter.

    \name{} shrugs. "There are dozens of different varieties. Some only have three verses, others have twenty or more. Some are whimsical, others horrifying. But they never find him. At least, 
    not in any of the versions I've heard."

    "Dark." Peter shifts a bit closer to \name{}.

    "Maybe. But I've never heard a version where the kids gave up either," says \name{}.

    Another beat of silence.

    "Anne seems to like you," says Peter. "I was a little worried, because you know, her mother."

    "What happened to her? Did she die?" asks \name{}.

    Peter shakes his head. "Left."

    "Why?"

    "I don't want to discuss it," says Peter curtly, pushing himself to his feet.

    "You're the one who brought her up," says \name{} defensively.

    "It was a mistake. Sorry. Didn't mean to snap at you," says Peter as he pays careful attention to brushing off his trousers. "Brings back bad memories, is all."

    At that moment, Sebastian, and another, relatively short and squat man, enter the backyard.

    Peter smiles. "Dan, hey. How's life?"

    Peter's smile wavers before Dan's grim look.

    "Sebastian, could you take Anne inside?" asks Peter.

    \name{} pulls Anne into \hisher{} arms and pushes \himselfherself{} to \hisher{} feet. Anne stirs and her face presses against \names{} shoulder.

    Sebastian takes the girl, whose eyes flutter open.

    "Daddy?" asks Anne.

    "Just go inside and see grandma, sweetheart," says Peter, giving the girl a tender smile.

    "Hmm. Bye \nickname{}," says Anne sleepily as Sebastian carries her inside.

    As Sebastian and Anne leave, \name{} becomes aware of Dan studying \himher{}. \name{} shifts from foot to foot.

    "'Kay." Anne skips into the home.

    Peter smiles as he watches his daughter leave. "You know, I really am grateful for your help with Anne. Means a lot to me. And Grandpa was so dissapointed that his magic skipped not one, but two generations. I'm sure he'd be delighted to see his 
    great-grandkid learning magic."

    \name{} shrugs. "Well, you are paying me, and I do need the money."

    "Yeah, but I still appreciate it," says Peter. He turns back to his forge. "Makes me sleep a hell of a lot better at night."

    \name{} nods. \HeShe{} decides to run through a few of \hisher{} own meditation exercises. Things have been chaotic at the guild for the past few weeks, and Peter's yard is nice and peaceful. 
    Perfect place for a bit of sitting and thinking.

    "You're kidding," says Peter. "Dan, why?"

    Dan shrugs. "My order got canceled too. You know Jake the herder, right? Got that big herd of sheep and goats he migrates between here and some kingdom farther north? You know, keeps them there during the winter, brings them down here to escape the summer
    heat?"

    "Yeah, I know him," says Peter impatiently.

    "Well, just got a letter from him." Dan holds up a crumpled piece of paper. "Bastard's not coming here this summer. Too unstable he says. Too close to Bonda. Got himself a deal worked out with 
    the city of Alesia to summer there instead." 

    Peter takes the letter and reads it. He sags, and hands it back. "I see."

    "I'm sorry," says Dan. He glances about the small yard, careful not to look at \name{}. "I know things have been hard for you lately, and you were depending on this. I mean, it hurts me too, but I've got other projects. Might have to patch old clothing a bit

    "Do you see any apprentices here?" roars Peter, his arm sweeping out to take in the smithy, his heavy hand almost hitting Dan.

    Dan and \name{} back up a step. Peter's voice echoes and reechoes through the yard. 
    
    Sebastian puts a hand on Peter's shoulder. "Calm down, son."

    Peter takes a deep breath. "It's keeping us fed and sheltered. The food is crap, and the shelter's cold, but it's something."

    "Sorry," says Dan. "Wish I could do more, but--"

    "I know, I know, coming to me was risky enough as it was," says Peter. "Barely justified by the size of the order and my light workload. I appreciate it, Dan, and I'm sorry for yelling like that. I'll make it work. There's actually been a project I've been
    thinking of proposing to Adrian, to make his guild a bit more secure. It'll be pretty complicated, and I'll probably have to charge barely above the cost of materials, but it should be enough to get us through the summer. I hope."

    "If you want, I can talk to Adrian," says \name{}.

    Peter shakes his head. "I appreciate the offer, but Dad or I'll take care of it. Probably Dad. He and Adrian get along better."

    "Ok," says \name{}. "But if you need anything, ask."

    Elise tenses when she sees \name{}, and glances at Samantha, who has also tensed.

    "\name{}," says Sister Samantha. "I, I wasn't expecting to see you here, all things considered. And I'm sorry, about what I said. I know nothing about your history, or how much you've suffered because of the Church's actions. I was too wrapped up in my own pain to 
    see yours."

    "Of course," says Sister Samantha. She stands. "I should probably check in on my Sisters anyway. Make sure our kids aren't eating them alive."

    Sister Samantha leaves the room.

    "You really should let her apologize," says Elise. "She said something stupid, she knows she said something stupid and it's tearing her up."

    "I don't want to talk about it," says \name{} curtly. "I just wanted to see if you needed anything for Carrie's graduation party."

    "Making up with Sister Samantha so that things aren't awkward at the party?" says Elise with an uneasy smile.

    \name{} scowls.

    "Come on, \nickname{}," says Elise. "Don't you think you're making a bit of a big deal out of this? I mean, yeah, she said something stupid and hurtful, but if I had an apple for everytime an otherwise decent person said something stupid and hurtful to someone 
    else, no one would go hungry again."

    "So because everyone does it, it's ok?" asks \name{}, crossing \hisher{} hands over \hisher{} chest.

    "No, of course not. I'm just, it's a part of life, you know? Alice is a jerk to Bob. Bob gets pissed. Alice feels bad. Bob forgives her, they move on. Sister Samantha raised us, and it sucks

    "Great. I'll go get her." Elise hurries out the door, a broad grin on her face.

    A few seconds later, Elise and Sister Samantha return.

    Sister Samantha and \name{} stare at each other for a moment.

    "I'm sorry," says Sister Samantha. "What I said was insensitive and cruel."

    "Yeah," says \name{}. "But whatever. It's not that big of a deal. I guess. Just don't do it again, alright?"

    Sister Samantha smiles. "I'll do my best."

    "Yes," Elise pumps her arm. "Score one for Elise's diplomatic acumen."

    Both \name{} and Sister Samantha give Elise incredulous looks.

    "What? It was totally my irresistible charisma that convinced \name{} to forgive you," says Elise.

    "If you say so dear," says Sister Samantha, sitting behind her desk.

    "It was!"

    "And I was agreeing with you."

    "Not according to your voice tone."

    Sister Samantha turns to \name{}. "So, is there anything you need?"

    "Well, I was just wondering if Elise needed my help with anything. You know, besides trying to smooth things over with you so that Carrie's party isn't awkward or anything," says \name{}.

    "Come on, Elise, don't be like that," says \name{} at last.

    "Well for starters you could assassinate Amelia Silverstone," says Elise sardonically.

    "Sister Elizabeth," says Sister Samantha. She leans over the desk and swats Elise's bottom. "That was grossly inappropriate."

    "I was just joking." Elise hops a little, and snaps her hands back to shield her bottom. "Can't you take a joke?"

    "Joke or not, it was very disrespectful," says Sister Samantha as she settles back into her chair. "Not only is she a member of the king's inner circle, but she will be your mother-in-law in a little over a month. A proper lady does not joke about murdering
    her mother-in-law."

    "Then being a proper lady sucks," says Elise as she rubs her bottom.

    "Well, you won't get any argument from me on that one," says Sister Samantha, folding her hands on her desk.

    \name{} frowns. "What does your future mother-in-law have to do with Carrie's party?"

    Sister Samantha groans, and buries her face in her hand.

    "Excellent question, and one that's afflicted me for weeks. The bi--" Elise stops and glances at Sister Samantha. 
    
    Sister Samantha doesn't return the look. She's too busy studying her wall of implements.

    "Dame Silvestone has decided that I should invite a variety of young noblewomen my own age to this party, despite the fact that none of them even know Carrie exists, let alone care about her graduation. Apparently, she thinks this
    would be a great way for me to start ingratiating myself with them. Because nothing is so sacred that Dame Silverstone won't try to use it for political gain," says Elise in a syrupy sweet voice. "She's so very brilliant. When I grow up, I want to be just like
    her."

    "Elise, words aren't the only way to be disrespectful," says Sister Samantha in a warning tone. 

    "Well it's dumb," says Elise, crossing her arms over her chest. "I am not going to use my best friend's graduation as an excuse to score political points. This party should be about Carrie. The wedding will be plenty of opportunity to 'ingratiate' myself with
    whoever the hell Amelia wants me to ingratiate myself with. And you raised me with too much integrity to fake respect."

    Sister Samantha rests her cheek in her hand, and gives Elise a look containing a mixture of pride and exasperation. "Indeed. Just one of my many mistakes. The nobility are going to eat you alive, 
    and Roland won't be able to help you. Guy's as crafty as a box of rocks."

    Elise bristles. "Roland is perfectly intelligent."

    "I didn't say he was stupid, I said he wasn't crafty," says Sister Samantha. "Big difference. Dame Silverstone on the other hand, is politically savvy enough to be downright dangerous. While I agree that Carrie's graduation should be about her, and not about you, 
    I would suggest that you do give some thought to Dame Silverstone's suggestions in the future. Following her suggestions will ensure you a solid position in the gossip hierarchy."
    
    "Like I care about that," says Elise. "Anyway, is Brother Mathew still at the Lowen Monastery?"

    Sister Samantha makes a face. "You're not really suggesting we invite him, are you? Last time he saw Carrie, she slipped a laxative in his drink."

    "Oh come on, that was like five years ago," says Elise.

    "Three."

    "Whatever. I'm sure he's over it," says Elise. "He always did have a good sense of humor. And he was one of our best teachers."

    "I'll just be going," says \name{}.

    "You better not miss the party," says Elise. "Carrie'd be devastating."

    "Speaking of which, where is Carrie?" asks \name{}. "I want to drop by and see how she's doing."

    Sister Samantha cocks her head thoughtfully. "Umm...I think she's working with Sister Terese right now. You know, trying to create a version of potions that aren't as addictive, but just as potent. Just head back to the Shrine. I'll send a message to Carrie
    in a second."

    "Alright," says \name{}. "See you."

    "Bye," says Elise. "Anyway, is he--"

    \name{} steps outside and returns to the Shrine.

    \name{} paces anxiously around the shrine, the events of last night cycling endlessly through \hisher{} head. A lead weight sits in the pit of \hisher{} stomach.

    "Hey," says a small voice.

    \name{} turns to see Carrie standing in one of the doorways in the back of the shrine. Her hair is pulled back into a three-strand plaite. A light blue headband helps to keep her hair out of
    her face. She is wearing a long-sleeve shirt that completely 
    covers her chest and a pair of light blue trousers. Both the shirt and trousers are marred by a small collection of minor stains. A pair of worn, heavily stained brown oxhide 
    boots finishes off the ensemble. Carrie's shoulders are hunched, and she is staring fixedly at the floor. She holds a heavy wooden hairbrush in front of her, twisting and turning it.

    "Hi," says \name{}.

    There is a moment of awkward silence.

    "I'm sorry," says Carrie at last. "I didn't mean to be a jerk. I was kind of tipsy, and not really thinking right and, and I'm sorry."

    Carrie smiles a little. Then she holds out the brush. "Would you umm, would you paddle me?"

    \name{} approaches the student. "I don't think thats necessary."

    Carrie bites her lower lip, and holds the brush up higher. "Please? It'll make me feel better."

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{ep2 carrie lost temper chastise}{Andrew Russell}

    Carrie shrinks further into herself. She slips a strand of hair into her mouth and starts gnawing frantically. Still staring at the ground, she holds out the hairbrush for \name{} to take.

    "Are you asking for a paddling?" asks \name{} curtly.

    Carrie nods, and starts chomping harder.

    "Then look at me and ask for it," says \name{}.

    Carrie slowly raises her eyes up to \names{}, then flicks them back down again.

    \name{} crosses \hisher{} arms and waits.

    Carrie forces her eyes to meet \names{} stern gaze. She holds out the hairbrush, her hands shaking slightly. Her voice is choked, on the verge of tears. "Would you, would you spank me?"

    "Yes."

    \name{} takes the hairbrush and guides Carrie to one of the front row pews. \HeShe{} sits down and pats \hisher{} lap. "Pants down, and over my knee."

    Carrie gnaws anxiously on her lower lip, but obediantly shimmies her pants down her legs. Then she lays herself across \names{} lap, her large, bouncy bottom dominating \names{} view.
    As usual, the young woman is wearing only a g-string beneath her trousers, leaving her wobbling cheeks completely exposed. She squirms a little,
    \cond{'attractedToCarrie' in pwutilities.keywords()}{setting off a little fire in \names{} belly.}{trying to get comfortable.}

    \name{} presses firmly on the small of her back, and raises the hairbrush. "Ready?"

    Carrie squeaks and squirms.

    \name{} snaps \hisher{} arm down, cracking the hairbrush against Carrie's right cheek. Carrie yelps and kicks, her sensitive bottom rolling and bouncing beneath the heavy blow. \name{}
    flicks \hisher{} wrist and snaps the brush against Carrie's left cheek next. Carrie's bottom wiggles in pain as her left cheek flattens and bounces back. \name{} flicks \hisher{} wrist again,
    and again, and again. \HeShe{} smacks Carrie's rolling bottom with a rapid fire rhythm of wrist-flicks, letting the hairbrush's heavy oak do most of the work. Occasionally, \heshe{} punctuates
    the wrist flicks with a full armed swing that makes Carrie yell.

    It doesn't take much for Carrie to start to cry. She pounds her fists against the pew, and pounds one foot against the pew, while the other hammers the floor. However, for all Carrie's wailing 
    and carrying on, \name{} doesn't slow, and \heshe{} doesn't stop until Carrie's bottom is a solid red from top to bottom.
    
    "Alright. Get up," says \name{}.

    Carrie clambers off of \names{} lap, then throws herself into a hug with \name{}, burying her face in her punisher's shoulder and crying. \name{} wraps \hisher{} arms around Carrie's bobbing
    body, and rocks gently.

    "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," says Carrie through her sobs and \names{} shoulder. "I've felt terrible about it all day."

    "Hush. It's over. You're forgiven," says \name{}. 

    Carrie's cries a bit longer, but it isn't that much time before her sobs slow, and she pulls away. She clambers off of \names{} lap, and hikes her pants back up, wincing as the cloth rubs 
    against her flaming bottom. She smiles at \name{}, while wiping lingering tears off her face. "So, you up for a walk? I need to get out of this stuffy Church."

    "Need a break from all your crazy potion magic, eh?" \name{} stands.

    Carrie nods. "Mother's love, yes. Sometimes, I wonder if we'll ever make potions truly safe."

    "I'm sure you'll figure it out," says \name{}, giving Carrie's shoulders a squeeze. "You're a smart girl."

    "Except when I'm not," mutters Carrie, scuffing her boot against the floor.

    "Oh, don't be so hard on yourself." \name{} gives Carrie's bottom a light tap, and starts to walk towards the double doors. "Everyone's smart except for when they're not."

    Eventually, Carrie comes bouncing in, her eyes sparkling, and a broad grin on her face. Her hair is pulled back into a three-strand plaite. A light blue headband helps to keep her hair out of

    the closest pew.}

    Carrie rubs her forehead and shakes her head. The sparkle fades a little from her eyes, and her face grows drawn and tired. "Terrible doesn't even begin to describe it. Our latest variation is 
    even more unstable than usual. And since instability is correlated with addiction... 
    Which, ok, that doesn't prove anything of course, but it's a pretty strong correlation, so it's a good rule of thumb, least until we get a better handle on why these wretched things are so
    addictive in the first place... Gah! Sometimes I wonder if we'll ever make them safe."

    "Unstable?" says \name{} uneasily. "What do you mean by unstable?"

    "I mean potion plus flame equals bigger boom than normal," says Carrie, spreading her arms out in semblance of an explosion. 

    "And you experiment on them. In the same building as an orphanage," says \name{}, glancing towards the door. "And did you say 'bigger boom than normal?' As in, regular potions can explode too?"

    "Relax." Carrie flicks her fingers. "The miniscule quantities we work with, there wouldn't be an explosion, so much as a brief burst of flame that might burn a hand. 
    Nothing your health can't handle. And our normal potions are kept deep in the cellar downstairs, surrounded by moist dirt, and without anything but dirt above them."

    "I see."

    "Anyway, come on, it's a beautiful day and I've been stuck in that stupid lab for hours." Carrie grabs \names{} hand and pulls \himher{} outside onto the Church steps. \name{} follows along 
    only too eagerly.

    As the two step out into the warm sunlight, Carrie throws her hands into the air, arcs her back, and stretches. Then she gives herself a little shake. "Hmm. Sunlight. Best invention ever." 

    "So you say now," says \name{}. \HeShe{} leans against the handrail. "Dirt to gold says you'll be sick of it in two months."

    Carrie shrugs. "Prolly. All the more reason to appreciate it now. Come on, I need to get away from the Church for a bit."

    The two dive into the crowded town square. The sparkle returns in full force to Carrie's eyes as the two weave through the crowd. She starts to skip a little, as if drawing
    energy from the chaotic crush of people all around them. She stops and surveys the baubles and bits of food from street merchants, stops to watch shows by street magicians, or listen to the
    music of street musicians, tossing a few matrons to particularly good acts.

    Eventually, the two find themselves at the entrance to the Craftman's Corridor, just outside of Terry's Tailors.

    A sly expression spreads across Carrie's face. She puts her hands behind her back and leans towards \name{}. "How'd you like to do me a favor, \nickname{}?"

    "What kind of favor?" asks \name{}.

    "You ever wonder how Terry's Tailors manages to make so much clothing?" asks Carrie. She bobs her knees, bites her lower lip and just does her level best to be as cutely innocent as possible. 
    "Well, how'd you like to find out?"

    "Why do I get the feeling that 'ask Terry' isn't a part of your master plan?" says \name{}, leaning backward slightly to maintain some space between \himselfherself{} and Carrie.

    Carrie pouts. "I tried that. Jerk told me to mind my own business. So I've got a better idea!"

    Carrie jumps up and down in excitement, then grabs \names{} hand and pulls \himher{} towards the side of the road. The two stop next to a cooper's, so marked by a pair of large barrels sitting
    in front of the shop. She tugs \names{} head close, and speaks in a whisper. "The way I see it,
    there are probably clues hidden in Terry's office, back behind the counter. Thing is, she spends most of her time in the office, so we need to draw her out. She usually only comes out 
    if a customer makes a big enough fuss."

    Carrie gives \name{} a crafty look, but doesn't say anything, as if waiting for \name{} to fill in the gaps. \name{} however, remains silent. 

    Carrie's pout returns. "You're no fun."

    \name{} shrugs. "Your idea. You gotta say it."

    "We won't get caught," says Carrie, grinning broadly. "Now come on, all I need from you is a teensy tiny distraction. Just make a fuss until Terry comes out of her office, and keep up the fuss 
    while I search her office for something interesting, 'K? Trust me, nothing bad'll happen. I mean, if she pisses you off, she'll lose a customer. And no shop owner wants to lose a customer. She
    might even give you a free article of clothing."

    \stageDirections{Carrie reveals that if they get caught, Samantha will probably just invoke Sanctuary, and give them both a good hiding.}

    "Oh, that's not a problem," says Carrie breezily with a dismissive flick of the wrist. "If we get arrested, Sister Sam will just invoke Sanctuary. Roland will complain, but he always
    complains, sourpuss that he is. Granted, Sister Sam'll probably cane the skin off our butts, but eh. Not like we'll be hooked, or forced to sit in a dank cell eating rat meat or something." 

    \name{} frowns. "Sanctuary?"

    Carrie nods. "Yeah! See, the Matirian Church is special, being the manifestation of the Mother's will on earth and all that. So the Church's primary obligation is to the Mother's laws, not 
    the king's. So any full Brother or Sister of the Church can invoke Sanctuary on someone, basically shielding them from persecution from the city guard."

    "That's horrible," cries \name{}, backing up a step. "So a Sister could literally get away with murder?"

    "Of course not," snaps Carrie. "No one would ever invoke Sanctuary for something like that. Only for silly little things like what we're gonna do, you know, harmless little things, or 
    to protect Brothers and Sisters against unjust laws. For example, suppose one of those Vengadores or whatever is severely hurt in battle against the guards and is dying. Well, technically if
    a Sister goes to the Vengador's aid, she'd be helping a rebel, right? She could easily be arrested for that. But she was also obeying the Mother's tenet to care for all Her children. In that 
    case, another Sister would invoke Sanctuary on the Sister and her patient, least until the Vengador has been fully treated. Then, the Sister isn't forced to choose between doing
    what's right, and staying out of prison."

    "But what's to keep you guys from abusing it?" says \name{}.

    "I'm your \cond{'ep2CarrieSex' in pwutilities.keywords()}{lover}{friend}. That makes you my responsibility," says \name{}. \HeShe{} leans over and administers a burst of heavy slaps to
    Carrie's sitspots. Carrie squeals and shakes her bottom. "Now stop whining, and stop squirming or your pants are coming down."

    "You wouldn't," says Carrie, her face is scarlet and turning redder by the second. She glances towards the crowded street, while \name{} continues to batter Carrie's soft bubble butt.

    "Mommy, look that girl has been naughty!" says a young boy, pointing at \name{} and Carrie.

    "Yes she has," says the mother, giving her son's arm a light tug to keep him moving on.

    "What do you think she did?" asks the boy as the two wander off into the crowd.

    "Now that's not really our business, is it?"

    "Look at that girl's bottom bounce," says a man. He is standing outside a cobbler, with his arm around a woman's shoulders. "How come your bottom doesn't bounce like that?"

    His girlfriend glares at him, then sniffs dismissively. "Because I work for a living. Not some fancy pants noble in well-made clothing sitting around eating rich food all day. Now come on,
    you're starting to drool."

    "If there's one thing I've learned from Nana, it's never make empty threats when dealing with bratty girls," says \name{}. \HeShe{} cracks \hisher{} palm against the fleshiest part of 
    Carrie's left cheek, making the girl squeak and squirm.

    Carrie stomps her foot. "This isn't fair!"

    An older woman walking by shakes her head. "When will young folk learn to just shut up and take their licks? When I was their age..."

    Then the coopery door opens, and an irate, middle-aged man sticks his head out. "Hey, you stupid kids, what do you think you're doing? Those are display pieces, not whipping posts. Get out 
    of here 'fore I whip both your asses."

    "Sorry sir," says \name{}. \HeShe{} pulls Carrie up, and guides her back towards the street, \hisher{} hand clapping against Carrie's bottom the whole way. "We'll move along then." 

    The cooper grunts grumpily, and disappears back into the shop.

    "Ok, ok you can stop now," says Carrie, her hands snaking back to deflect \names{} hand. "I've learned my lesson I promise."

    \name{} snags Carrie's wrists and lands three final stinging blows to Carrie's bottom. "You going to go through with your little scheme?"

    "No," says Carrie, dancing a few steps away from \name{} and furiously rubbing her bottom. She pouts at \name{}. "Why is your hand so hard?"

    "Magic," says \name{}. \HeShe{} puts \hisher{} hands on \hisher{} hips. "You better not be lying to me. Because if I find out later that you are, you're going over my knee, and you're not

    good spanking, while the player looks for some clue into why Terry's shop produces so much clothing.}

    Carrie's smile slips a little. "No, no, I think it's best if you serve as the distraction. I mean, you don't know what to look for right? But I do, seeing as how I'm a hobbyist seamstress and 
    all."

    "Not that complicated. Look for documents that look interesting," says \name{}. "Directions on how to make a dress, or communications with her seamstresses, or whoever she gets her fabric from,
    you know. That type of thing."

    "Well, yes but you won't be able to filter out the important from the unimportant--"

    "Oh come on. At this point we have no idea what's important and what isn't," says \name{}. "Besides, what are you so anxious about? You just said it's not a big deal. If anything, I'll be
    the one taking the bigger risk."

    "Well, I suppose," says Carrie, shifting anxiously from foot to foot. "Oh, alright fine. I'll provide the distraction, while you slip into her office. You go in first, start browsing, make
    your way towards Terry's office. I'll come in a few minutes later, and start making a scene. Once Terry comes out, you slip in, find a few things that look interesting, and grab them. Don't
    grab too much though. The more you grab, the more likely it is she'll notice something's missing."

    \name{} nods, and makes \hisher{} way to the tailors. As \heshe{} enters the large shop, Carol approaches with a large smile.

    "Hello," she says. "How can I help you?" 

    "I'm just browsing, for now," says \name{}, \hisher{} eyes sweeping the large space. It doesn't take \himher{} long to find Terry's office, situated next to the...women's panties. 
    \isfemale{Well, nothing like a little bit of lingerie shopping. \cond{'attractedToAlondra'in pwutilities.keywords()}{Maybe there's something here Alondra would enjoy...}{

              {Crap. This is going to be awkward.}

    \name{} slowly meanders about the store, looking at various trousers, shirts, and dresses. Eventually, \heshe{} makes \hisher{} way to the lingerie section and begins a careful study of the
    thongs, g-strings, garters, boyshorts, frilly panties, plain panties, purple panties, pink panties...

    "Excuse me," says Carrie from the front of the store. She is holding a white sundress against her body. 

    Carol approaches Carrie. "Yes miss?"

    "I think I'd like to purchase this," says Carrie.  "Ten mats, right?"

    Carol looks at the dress, then over at the dresses next to it. She frowns. "Actually, ma'am, it's fifteen."

    "No it's not," says Carrie. She reaches over and grabs an obviously-misfiled, ankle-length skirt that was hanging next to it. "See? This is ten? Don't you guys price similar things the same?"
   
    Carol looks at the skirt. Then at Carrie. "Miss, that is clearly a skirt. You're holding a sundress."

    "Oh come on, what's the difference?" says Carrie. "Besides, they use practically the same amount of fabric. I'll give you ten."

    "Miss, this is not a market stall. We have neither the time nor the staff to negotiate with each customer. That skirt is clearly in the wrong spot." Carol reaches for the skirt. "I'll just 
    take it from you--"

    "No!" Carrie snatches it back. "Maybe I want to buy this too. You ever consider that? Where do you go snatching things out of your customer's hands? Mother's mercy, didn't whoever owns this
    dump teach you a thing about being polite to your customers? You know I could make a dress ten times as good as this for a tenth of the price. So don't think I'm going to put up with your
    crap because I have to. Because I don't. I'll take these two for twenty matrons."

    "Sorry miss," says Carol. She is clearly working to keep her smile fixed firmly in place. "But it will be twenty-five."

    "I already told you, I'm not paying fifteen for this stupid dress," says Carrie, her voice growing louder with every word. She stomps her foot. "It's a simplistic piece of crap that looks like
    it was stitched by a three year old. Mother, this thing isn't even worth five, so you should be thanking me for offering ten!"

    "Then why are you buying it?" asks Carol sharply.

    "Don't get snippy with me," says Carrie. By now she's practically shouting, and every eye is drawn to the spectacle. "I'll buy whatever I damn well please, and I'm not going to pay a matron
    more than it's worth!"

    At this point, the door to Terry's office finally opens, and the woman steps out. She's a short, squat, hard-faced Carnutian woman, and if the black scowl fixed on her face is anything to go by,
    a 
    serious spitfire. She is also carrying a wooden hip curve in one fist. \name{} backs up a step, making sure to give Terry a wide berth. And Carrie wanted \himher{} to confront that? \name{}
    glances at Carrie. The woman has stopped shouting, and is now nervously gnawing on her lip while watching Terry approach. \name{} feels like a bucket of ice is dumped on \hisher{} head as 
    \heshe{} comes to a horrifying realization. One. Carrie is about to get her bottom smacked, and smacked hard. Two. She knew that whoever made the scene was going to get their bottom smacked.
    She knew. And she lied to \name{} about it.

    \name{} is tempted just to stand there and watch. But a quick pleading look from Carrie makes \himher{} sigh. \HeShe{} glances around, and seeing everyone still transfixed by the scene, slips 
    through the open office door.

    And is confronted by the site of what must have been a bitter days-long battle in a bitter, decades-long war. Dozens of scrambled, collapsing piles of parchment cover the desk. More piles are
    scattered about the floor, many of them sagging and mixing with each other. There are three chairs in the room, two of them are covered in piles of fabric and dress making tools. A thin ratan
    cane and a paddle lean against the far corner, a strap laying curled up on the floor in front of them. Against the other wall is a slab of wood with a cord woven through two holes in the top.

    This is perfect. Grab a few things from one of the less important piles (one of the ones on the floor), and Terry will never miss them. If she does, she'll figure she lost them in the realm
    of chaos that is her office.

    Nice and quick, in and out--

    THWACK! 

    "OWW!"

    \name{} cocks \hisher{} head, and listens to the sound of wood on (bare!) flesh, accompanied by Carrie's wails. Yes, must definitely be quick. \name{} hurries over to the nearest pile and 
    starts rifling through it.

    THWACK!

    "I'm sorry!" 

    \name{} studies one of the documents with a bunch of drawings. Unfortunately, the text is all gibberish. And not shorthand gibberish. It looks like full text beneath the design, but the letters
    are scrambled.

    THWACK! THWACK! THWACK!

    "Stop, stop please stop! I'll pay, I'll pay, just please stop!"

    \name{} grabs a few more sheets. Gibberish. Gibberish. It's all freaking gibberish!

    THWACK! THWACK! THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK!

    "Owwwww! Mother's love it huuuuurts!"

    Wait. Wasn't there something Nana said? Ciphers, or something. 

    THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK! THWACKTHWACKTHWACKTHWACK!

    "Waaaaaah!"

    Right! People would obscure texts using some sort of key, telling you how to rearrange the letters. Most aren't very good though. Best you can expect from a cipher is to delay a determined
    enemy, not stop them. Of course, in wartime delay might be all you need, but here-

    THWACKTHWACKTHWACKTHWACKTHWACKTHWACKTHWACKTHWACK!

    "Waaaaaah!"

    \name{} snatches up four parchments and shoves them into \hisher{} satchel. Then, \heshe{} slips back out.

    Terry is sitting on a bench in front of the dresses, with Carrie sprawled across her lap. Carrie's pants are around her ankles, and her naked, bright red cheeks are exposed for all to see. 
    \cond{'ep2BeginningSpankedCarrie'}{Terry has even gone so far as to tug down Carrie's panties, bunching them up around Carrie's knees.}{At 
    first \name{} thinks Carrie isn't wearing any panties, but then
    \heshe{} spies the small strip of silver cloth obscuring the woman's womanhood. Right, G-String. Carrie's favorite style. Kind of strange really, considering the girl's habit of ending up across
people's laps with her pants around her ankles.}

    "Look at her bottom bounce," says a nearby customer.

    "I know. I swear, sometimes I think I shop here just to watch the bouncing bottoms of blubbering brats," says another.

    "And how long have you been waiting for a chance to say that?" asks the first.

    "About two months."

    "I'm so jealous," says a man, as he watches Terry whale away at Carrie's bobbing bottom. "If I spanked one of my customers..."

    "Just one of the many rewards for success," says his wife, while she holds a dress up to her squirmy daughter. "So maybe you should be trying to find new customers, instead of shopping with me."

    "Nah. Paddling a dozen entitled customers isn't worth a minute of unnecessary time away from you two."

    The mother smiles. "And here momma was worried."

    Terry lands a particular hard blow right across the middle of Carrie's cheeks, flattening both of the pillowy orbs and making them bounce. Carrie's legs kick, but the only sound she makes is a 
    deep, continuos cry. 
    "Now, I want you up, and against the wall there."

    \name{}'s gaze follows where Terry is pointing, and sees a large column right in front of the door. It's the first thing customers see when they enter. \name{} cocks \hisher{}
    head thoughtfully. \HeShe{}'d always wondered why that column was where it was. Always seemed kind of silly to obscure the merchandise with a bare wooden column.

    "Carol, fetch me the sign," says Terry. She keeps a firm grip on Carrie's ear as the young woman clambers off of her lap.

    Carol nods and hurries towards Terry's office, her grin on the verge of splitting her face in two. \name{} tenses, but the woman comes out almost as soon as she went in, the large wooden
    sign under one arm. If she noticed anything amiss, she doesn't show it.

    By this time, Carrie has shuffled over to the pillar, and is standing with her hands and nose squashed against it. Terry takes the sign and slings it over Carrie's head so that it hangs
    against her back. \name{} circles around to see what the sign says. It reads "Another Satisfied Customer."

    Terry stands behind Carrie, studying the woman's bottom like a painter studying a just-finished piece. "Now, how will you treat my employees?"

    "With respect ma'am," mumbles Carrie.

    "Good. And if you don't like one of our dresses, what will you do?"

    "Put it away and find another one," mumbles Carrie, her bottom clenching and twitching.

    "Good. Carol, keep her here about a quarter-glass or so," says Terry, turning to her employee.

    Carol's smile slips a little. "That's it?"

    "Compared to some of the brats we've had to deal with, she wasn't all that bad," says Terry. "No foul language. Didn't throw anything at you. Yeah, I think a quarter-class will be fine."

    \name{} stares at Carrie's heavily welted bottom. That's the mess Terry makes when a customer "wasn't all that bad?" May La Madre have mercy on customers who are "that bad."

    Carol nods. "Oh fine."

    Terry raises an eyebrow. "Your shaudenfreude does you no favors young lady. Now, if you'll excuse me." Terry returns to her office, closing the door behind her.

    At that point, \name{} decides to leave.

    \name{} makes \hisher{} way to the Guild, and plops down on a bench in front of it. \HeShe{} sits and just watches people move and shop through the Corridor. Eventually,
    Carrie comes shuffling through the crowd, one hand rubbing her bottom, and the other wiping her face.

    "Please tell me you found something useful," says Carrie. She hops back and forth a little bit, and furiously rubs her bottom. "Mother's love, that stupid hip curve hurts even more 
    than I thought it would."

    "More than you thought it would," says \name{} flatly. "Because you knew that crazy lady was going to soundly paddle whichever one of us provided the distraction."

    Carrie smiles sheepishly. "Maybe? Oh come on. You've been here a month. Surely you've seen her deal with an obnoxious customer before."

    "I've only been there a few times," says \name{}. "Hard to shop for clothes when you have no money."

    "Oh. Well, anyway what does it matter?" says Carrie hastily. "I mean, it's not like you're the one who got her booty blistered--"

    "No, but I would have been if you'd had your way," says \name{}, scowling at Carrie. "And what was it you said? Oh nothing will happen, I'm a customer, and they don't want to lose a sale. You 
    knew that you were asking me to get my butt smacked. You lied to me."

    Carrie's smile fades. She slips a strand of hair into her mouth, and scuffs the ground. "Sorry."

    "The only reason you're not across my lap and squealing yourself hoarse right now is because Terry spanked you hard enough for the both of us. Well, that and I kind of suspected you were
    fudging the truth."

    Carrie nods. "Sorry."
    
    "Moving on to happier things, check it out." \name{} pulls out the sheets of parchment and hands them to Carrie. Carrie's eyes light up and she snatches them up. As soon as she sees what's 
    written, her glee turns into confusion.

    "It's just encrypted. Don't worry, a few months of steady work, and we'll have it broken," says \name{}. "Probably."

    Carrie nods thoughtfully. "A friend of mine is really into this kind of thing. Says they're like puzzles, you know like those smith puzzles or whatever. He and a bunch of his friends get together
    regularly. They each try to come up with a more clever scheme, and then use it. The one whose message is broken first has to buy the beer. I'll have to talk to him about it."

    Carrie goes first, and \name{} waits a short while before entering the store as well. \name{} glances about the store, and spies Carrie in the lingerie section. Carrie flashes \himher{} a 
    smile, before returning to a careful study of a rather small strip of fabric. Or maybe several strips. Hard to tell, really.

    \name{} approaches the shirts, and starts rifling through them, while trying to figure out the best way to make a scene. What did one make a scene about anyway? The price? The fact that they
    didn't let you barter? What kind of merchant doesn't let you barter? It's a wonder they stay in business. 

    "May I help you \sirmaam{}?" asks a voice behind \names{} right shoulder.

    "Globos de la Madre!" \name{} jumps ten feet in the air. 

    A bunch of other customers glance over and chuckle. \names{} face heats.

    "I'm sorry, \sirmaam{}," says the woman, Carol. "I didn't mean to startle you."

    "Well then you shouldn't have snuck up on me like that," snaps \name{}. 

    "Again, I'm sorry," says Carol. "Is there anything I can help you with?"

    \name{} opens \hisher{} mouth to dismiss the whole thing and move on, but then an idea occurs to \himher{}. "Yeah, you can stop sneaking up on people! Madre, woman you scared me half to 
    death! Do you know what I do for a living? I work for the Adventurer's Guild! You know how fighters like me react to surprises? We attack them!"

    Carol's face goes pale, and she backs up a step. "Are you threatening me \sirmaam{}? Again, I'm sorry."

    "What? No, of course not, what do you think I am, a thug?" snaps \name{}. "Look, I'm just warning you to be careful, alright? I mean, what if I'd hurt you? Or lit some of these shirts on 
    fire? Then your money-grubbing boss would probably make me pay for them all. Doesn't matter that it'd be your fault for making me panic and sling a spell in the first place, I'd still be the
    one who pays for them. Do I look like I can afford to replace half a dozen shirts? Madre, I can barely afford the ragged piece of crap I'm wearing right now!"

    Carol stares at \name{}. "Umm, but you didn't \sirmaam{}, so I don't see--"

    "Sure, but I might have. Maybe one of my friends will come in later, and you'll sneak up on them all creepy like and you'll startle them and--and what are you doing walking up and bothering me
    anyway? It drives me crazy when I'm just minding my own business, and browsing your goods when you people come waltzing up and start badgering me. Of course I don't need any help. If I needed
    help, I'd come and get it! So why don't you--"

    "What seems to be the problem here?" asks a sharp voice behind \name{}.

    \name{} jumps and spins around. "Gaah! What is with you people and sneaking up on people? Do you have any idea how annoying that is? Circle around to the front like a normal person would you?"

    The woman raises an eyebrow, and \name{} gets a good look at her. The woman is short, \pheight{about the same height as \name{}}{a little shorter than \name{}.}{significantly shorter than 
    \name{}.}
    {very short. In fact, she barely comes up to \names{} chest.} She is standing with her fists on her hips, a wooden hip curve clutched in one of them. She is glaring at \name{}, and despite her
    short stature, \name{} can't help but feel the woman is towering over \himher{}. With a terrible sinking feeling, \name{} starts to realize that a free shirt is not what \heshe{} will be getting
    today.

    "Like I said, what seems to be the problem here?" says the woman.

    "I was just standing here, looking at shirts, minding my own business, when your employee snuck up on me. Scared me half to death. Then, she asks me if I needed anything. Was I looking
    at her? No. Did I flag her down? No. I was just standing here minding my own business, looking at shirts, when she comes up and starts bothering me. Can't a \manwoman{} have some privacy?"

    "So in other words, you were shopping, my employee did what she was supposed to do, accidentally startled you, and humiliated you, big tough adventurer that you are. So, you decided to get
    some payback by humiliating my employee," says Terry. She begins tapping the hip curve against her thigh.

    \name{} bites \hisher{} lip, and glances briefly at the office door. No sign of Carrie. What was taking that girl so long? \HeShe{} takes a deep breath. "I'm doing no such thing. I don't 
    care about them. Not like I'm ever going to see them again. I'm just telling your obnoxious employee there how to do her job--hey!"

    Terry grabs \names{} wrist and drags \himher{} towards a nearby bench. 

    "Hey, what do you think you're doing?" asks \name{}. \HeShe{} tugs a little bit on \hisher{} arm, but doesn't really put \hisher{} heart in it. It doesn't help that the woman has a much
    stronger grip than \name{} expected.

    "If you don't know an impending spanking when you see one, then it's no wonder you're so obnoxious." Terry sits down. "Now get that bratty bottom across my lap!"

    The order is spoken with such force, that \name{} is halfway across the woman's lap before the order even fully registers. By then, it's a simple matter for Terry to push \himher{} the rest of
    the way down.

    A few seconds later, \names{} \pwearingdress{\trousers{} is flipped up over \hisher{} back}{\trousers{} 
    \cond{universal.state.player.lower\_clothing().armorType != items.Skirt.armorType}{are}{is} pooled around \names{} ankles.}{\underwear{} \cond{universal.state.player.underwear().armorType ==

    \cond{universal.state.player.marks}{"Hmmph. Looks like you do know what a spanking is. A pity your last one didn't take."}{"Look at that. Smooth and soft as silk. No wonder you're such an ass."} 
    The hip curve swishes through the air and slaps against \names{} 
    right cheek. \name{} squeals at the sharp sting, and \hisher{} feet kick.

    "You obnoxious little brat," says Terry, unleashing a flurry of stinging blows. "Of all the inane things to complain about. I suppose if Carol hadn't come up to you, you'd have complained about
     being ignored, hmm?"

     \name{} yelps and squirms.

     "Do you have any idea how much of my time you've wasted? Do you have any idea how busy I am?" Carol leans over and somehow manages to spank \name{} even faster. "I don't have time to be 
     dealing with troublemakers like you! I've got a business to run!"

     "Here here!" calls a man's voice. "I know your pain Terry, give it to her good! Maybe she'll treat other merchants with some respect to."

     Terry pauses long enough to flash the man a self-satisfied smile, before returning her attention to \names{} rapidly reddening bottom.

     "That's the problem with young people today," says an older woman to her friend over the slap of wood to bare flesh, and \names{} yelps. "No respect for anyone. Not their peers, not their
     elders, nobody."

     "I agree," says her friend. "Way I see it, the only respectful whippersnapper, is a red-bottomed whippersnapper."

     \name{} glances around. \HeShe{} spies Carrie near the pants section, behind a couple. She flashes \himher{} a thumbs up.

     "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I won't do it again," wails \name{}.

     "Good. Now let's make sure the lesson sinks in."

     "Buh? Waaaaaa!"

     Terry unleashes another unholy spate of swats, spreading a wave of flaming agony across \names{} throbbing bottom. \name{} squeals, kicks and squirms, babbled apologies pouring out of \hisher{}
     mouth.

     "Remind me never to get on Terry's bad side," says one of the other employees to Carol.

     "If you really need a reminder, then there's no hope for you."

     "Please no more!" wails \name{}, squirming about on Terry's lap. "I can't take it!"

     "Don't be silly, of course you can. It's just a paddling. You'd think a tough adventurer like you could handle a few slaps to \hisher{} bottom." Terry slaps \names{} bottom half a dozen more 
     times, three blows to each cheek. \name{} howls and thrashes \hisher{} way through each then. "See? Not so bad."

     \name{} answers with a sob.
     
     Alright then, get up," says Terry, giving \names{} bottom one last swat. "Carol, go get the sign please."

     \name{} scrambles to \hisher{} feet, and moves to fix \hisher{} clothing.

     "Hey now, what are you doing?" says Terry. She gives \names{} thigh a swat. "I didn't tell you to cover up."

     "But--"

     "You need some corner time first," says Terry as she stands. 

     "Corner--what?"

     Terry grabs \names{} ear in a painful pinch and drags \himher{} towards a large pillar situated in front of the doors. \name{}'d always wondered what that was for. Always seemed kind of 
     weird to have that blocking the merchandise. Terry pushes \name{} facefirst towards the pillar. "You're going to stand there until Carol tells you can come out. And no rubbing. You try to
     rub the sting away, and I'll have to put it back. Understand?"
     
     \name{} nods. Carrie is going to die. Carrie is going to die. Carrie is going to die! Then Terry drapes a sign over \names{} head. \name{} groans and leans \hisher{} head against the pillar.
     Carrie isn't going to die. No. Dying's too good for her. Something worse than death. She'll have to...clean \names{} toenails!

     "Another bratty customer?" says a woman's voice from the shop entrance. "Carol, isn't this like the third one this week? What's going on? You rearrange the store or something."

     "I don't know. Terry's getting really pissed though. She doesn't like being constantly interrupted  like this," says Carol.

     "I should think not." The woman gives \names{} exposed bottom a stinging slap, making \himher{} jump. "She's a busy woman."

     "Ma'am, please don't spank the other customers," says Carol in a long-suffering voice. "Or you'll be joining her."

     "If you insist. Though you ask me, \boygirl{}s like \himher{} deserve every smack you can give them and then some," says the woman, before she walks deeper into the store.

     Eventually, after what feels like an eternity, Carol tells \name{} \heshe{} can come out. Before Carol's done speaking, \names{} bottom is covered, and \heshe{} is out the door.

     \HeShe{} finds Carrie sitting on the bench in front of the Adventurer's Guild. She smiles hesitantly when \name{} comes out. "Hey \nickname{}--"

     \name{} grabs Carrie by the ear and drags her into the guild.

     "Hey, wait \nickname{}," says Carrie, shuffling after \name{}. "Come on, I know you're mad, but--"

     "You be quiet," says \name{}. \cond{'boarding\_with\_Adrian' not in pwutilities.keywords()}{"Hey Adrian, mind if I borrow a bedroom for a few

     Carrie starts to whimper. "Come on, \name{}, what's the big deal?"

     "Big deal? You knew that woman was going to spank me didn't you?" Once the two are in the room, \name{} bends Carrie over the bed, tugs down the girl's pants, and begins slapping her

     the woman's tiny g-string doing absolutely nothing to protect her bottom, as usual.}

     Carrie yelps and squirms. "Aww come on, I didn't know that. And maybe if you'd found something reasonable to complain about, you wouldn't have been spanked. Who complains about an assistant 
     sneaking up on them?"

     "Well it's not like we actually discussed what I was supposed to say," says \name{}. \HeShe{} starts slapping Carrie's bouncing cheeks harder. "I mean, what do you even complain about in 
     a place like that? Bunch of people waiting on you hand and foot like you're nobility. And you don't even have to pay them, unless you by something!" 

     "Well, like the prices or something, oww!" says Carrie, squirming. "Come on, \nickname{} stop!"

     "No. My ass is on fire because of you, you stupid girl," says \name{}. \HeShe{} pulls off \hisher{} sandal.

     Carrie's eyes widen. "No, not that, it's covered in mud!"

     \name{} glances at the mud-covered sandal. "So it is."

     \name{} proceeds to wipe it off on Carrie's thigh.

     "You stupid ass, stop it!" cries Carrie. "Mother, I'm covered in mud now."

     "So take a bath." \name{} cracks the hard leather sandal against Carrie's bare right cheek. The girl shrieks and bucks, her soft round bottom bobbing, bouncing and bucking.

     "You miserable--oww! Fine, I won't share what I--oww--found!" yelps Carrie.

     "Like I care," says \name{}, the sandal never slowing. "You'll probably drag me off on another hare-brained scheme that ends with me red-faced, red-bottomed, and smacking your ass."

     "Ok, ok, you're right I'm sorry," says Carrie, wiggling and squirming. "Please no more, it hurts!"

     "You going to lie to me about your schemes again?" asks \name{}.

     "No," says Carrie, sniffling miserably.

     "Good. Now let's drive the lesson home." \name{} unleashes another dozen hard and fast blows, six to each cheek. Carrie thrashes and wails her way through each one.

     Once \name{} finishes, \heshe{} gives Carrie's cheek a brief rub. "Alright. Now what did you find?"

     Carrie reaches back and rubs her marked bottom. "Mother, I think there's mud on my ass too."

     "Yeah, yeah. What you allergic to mud or something? Now what did you find?"

     Carrie pouts, but she reaches into the top of her shirt, and pulls out a few pages of crumpled pages. "Bunch of gibberish."

     \name{} takes the pages and studies them for a moment. "Nah. This isn't gibberish. It's ciphertext. Basically, Terry has some key that tells her how to rearrange the letters in the word so that
     nobody can read it unless they have the key. In theory anyway. In reality, most ciphers aren't that hard to break. They can delay a determined attacker by a few months, but not stop them. Now,
     in wartime that may be long enough. But for us..."

     "Really?" Carrie spins around and grabs one of the sheets, and studies it more closely, while hitching her pants back up. "You know, now that I think about it, I think one of my friends, one of 
     the other students, he's really
     into this stuff. Him and a bunch of his friends are always designing new schemes. They get together once a month and try to break each other's codes. The guy whose code gets broken first has
     to buy the beer. I'll have to get him to look at it. Anyway, I need to go. Got stuff to do, if I'm going to graduate."

     \name{} walks Carrie back out to the corridor.

    \name{} runs a hand anxiously through \hisher{} hair, as \heshe{} considers the door into the back of the guild. Four weeks \heshe{} had been putting it off. How many times had \heshe{} gotten
    up and decided "today was the day." The day \heshe{} finally confronted Airell and took the hell of a licking \heshe{} had coming. Not that it was \hisher{} fault or anything. Airell's a 
    pompous ass. But a pompous ass whose got the ear of Adrian.

    Best get it over with. Should have "gotten it over with" a month ago. Why didn't \heshe{} get it over with a month ago? \name{} enters the back of the guild, and makes \hisher{} way downstairs
    to Airell's classroom.

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{ep2 airell wait}{Bonemouth the Boxfish}

    \name{} paces anxiously back and forth in front of the hallway, \hisher{} stomach clenching nervously. A few times \heshe{} hears a sharp crack, followed by a cry of pain emanate from 
    Airell's classroom. \HeShe{} winces each time. That'll be \himher{} in a few minutes, only it won't be a single smack. Oh no, it'll be so much more.

    At one point, Cosima exits her own training room. She smiles when she sees \name{}. "Hey \nickname{}. What's up?"

    \name{} gestures to Airell's room.

    A knowing smirk creases Cosima's lips. "Oh I see. Finally paying your dues eh? I heard you punched Airell in the face. Is that true?"

    \name{} nods.

    "Bet you're regretting it now, huh?"

    \name{} shakes \hisher{} head.

    Cosima throws her head back and laughs. "Mother love, you've got spunk if nothing else."

    \name{} shrugs. "I'll be happy when it's over, though."

    later."}}

    With that, Cosima turned and headed up the stairs.

    Then, Airell's six students filter out. One of the adventurers throws \name{} a confused look. Then her friend leans in and whispers something. The girl's confusion turns into a smirk as
    the three make their down the hall towards Mai's maze. \name{} takes a deep breath, then enters the magic training room, \hisher{} eyes downcast. 

    "Ah, I've expected you. \name{}, is it?" asks Airell as \names{} footsteps echo across the room. 

    \name{} looks at the pale-skinned slinger whom \heshe{} had dared punch. \HeShe{} had the same wild red mane and bushy beard as always. \name{} wonders idly if the man has ever heard of a razor. 
    Airell is sitting at a desk in the corner of the damaged training room busying himself with paperwork. After several awkward seconds, he tells Juliana, "Well, don't just stand there. Bring that 
    stool out of the corner and place it in the middle of the room."

    \name{} complies. Airell opens his desk drawer and slides out a thick, 16-inch-long wooden paddle with two rows of holes running down its length. He then gets up from his desk and strides over 
    to \name{}. "Very well! Now, Morey was attempting to teach you a very important lesson when he punished you, initiate. Do you remember what it was?"

    \continue{ep2 remember what morey was trying to teach}

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{ep2 airell dont wait}{Bonemouth the Boxfish}

    \name{} nonchalantly enters the magic training room without so much as knocking. 

    "Stop right there, young \manlady{}!" cries the instructor, the pale-skinned slinger with the same wild red mane and bushy beard whom Juliana had dared punch in the nose. \name{} notices he's 
    standing next to a stool and brandishing that wicked switch she encountered earlier. "To the front of the class, please!"
    
    The students, paired up and hunched over small desks to  try and light a candle, look up to see the \pmusculature{soft}{fit}{muscular}, \pbodytype{short}{average}{tall}{massive} 
    \boygirl{} 
    stand in front of Airell. \name{} takes another breath, and tries not to wither under his stern gaze. 
    
    "I imagine you know why I'm here," says \name{}, trying to hide \hisher{} discomfort as the eyes of the six students bore into \himher{}. "Err, couldn't we get this over with in private while 
    the kids here do some busywork?"
    
"Impertinence!" The slinger's voice booms again as he snaps the switch down to his side. "You dare to interrupt my class, then insult my diligent students? Unlike you, 
\boygirl{}, they have been nothing but respectful." Airell strokes his hand through his thick beard and continues, "However, I surmise they won't be the only ones learning lessons today." 

\name{} rolls \hisher{} eyes. "How clever. Think of that all by yourself?"

"Indeed. Thought of this too." Airell brings up one hand, then the other in a swift motion. Energy immediately flows from them and coalesces into the ethereal hands of the Spectral Spanking spell 
\name{} is beginning to see far too often. However, this time, there's something new -- though the hands are smaller than the ones she's used to, there are three sets. 

"Wha--?" says \name{} as each of her wrists is clenched by a spectral hand. With a flick of his wrist, Airell directs them toward the tall stool at the front of the room. 
They drag their helpless captive towards the stool. Once at their destination, the hands easily bend \name{} over the stool, \pheight{}{which is lifted slightly into the air by two of the 
spectral hands,}{which is lifted into the
air by two of the spectral hands,}{which is lifted into the air by two of the spectal hands,} forcing \name{} to point \hisher{} toes downward to support the weight of \hisher{} lower body. The
hands holding \himher{}
clasp \hisher{} wrists tightly beside the legs of the stool's far side. Though \heshe{} has a good idea of what will happen next, \name{} nonetheless cranes \hisher{} neck around behind \himher{} 
to see not only the eager eyes of the students, but also the two remaining spectral hands come into an ominous position several inches behind and above \hisher{} bottom. \HeShe{} groans.

"Now, you keep it down while I finish today's lesson, \boygirl{}," says Airell. He flicks his wrist again. One spectral hand smacks the curved top of \names{} 
left cheek, and almost immediately after, the other smacks the same place on the opposite cheek. \name{} tenses at the sharp pain. This one-two motion is repeated five times in the same place before 
moving down half an inch.

\name{} swiftly learns that unlike the usual spell, each one of these Spectral Hands is uniquely shaped to \hisher{} \bumadj{} hindquarters. They don't even have to move laterally to perfectly 
cover the full swath of \hisher{} \bumadj{}, \quivering{} bottom. 

Seeing that his spell is acting as intended, Airell nonchalantly turns back to the classroom to finish his lecture. Meanwhile, \name{} struggles to remain silent as \hisher{} \muscleadj{} butt 
is endlessly drummed by two tireless, stinging hands. \HeShe{} quickly begins to deeply regret interrupting the slinger's class. Then the methodical hands reach \hisher{} sit spots. 

At that point, 
\heshe{} can't hold back the vocal protests. \HeShe{} also begins violently rocking \hisher{} hips to ease the sting. 

"Jessica! Leena!" exclaims Airell as he walks over to the desk shared by two young Carnutian women. The first is a raven-haired girl with large breasts spilling over onto her desk, and the other is 
the 
girl she was giggling with, a smaller, auburn-haired girl with a build not unlike Maria's. Both stop and sit upright at the instructor's roar.

"How many times have I had to tell you: if you can't focus while someone is being spanked, how can you expect to focus during a battle?" Airell sweeps the candle off the desk, and conjures yet 
another set of spectral hands, each of 
which roughly lifts a girl by the collar and bends her over the desk. Their bottoms wave in the air as a spectral bar presses against the small of the girls' backs, forcing them to arch their
backs and push up their bottoms, their
short pleated skirts riding high up the girls' thighs.

"W-we're sorry, sir," pleads Leena, while Jessica thrashes her legs from side to side in an attempt to right herself, giving the portion of the class not red-facedly looking away a glimpse of her 
pale butt cheeks. 

"I have had it with your apologies!" Airell strides up behind Lenna and lifts her skirt to reveal a pair of boyshorts that hug the girl's compact bottom. "It's a full dozen for you 
this time, girl!"

With that, Airell sets the girl's bottom ablaze with strokes from his switch that leave crimps in her boyshorts from top to bottom. She's sobbing by the time he crisscrosses the strokes across her 
entire bottom, which is firm enough to make the switch bounce right back after it lands, again and again. She howls after each and bucks her hips but to no avail.

"Let that be a lesson to you, girl," Airell admonishes with a final stroke of his switch, turning to Jessica. "As for you, troublemaker, it's double! Don't think I'm oblivion as to who instigates 
these outbursts." 

"You mean 'oblivious!' And I hope that old stick of yours breaks on me!" Jessica snarls as Airell drapes her skirt across her back, revealing an unmarked, creamy bottom with lacy panties flirting 
across its wide expanse. 

"We'll just have to make sure there's nothing in its way, then!" Airell exclaims as he tugs down the tight-fitting panties, leaving Jessica's most intimate parts exposed to most of the class as 
several students gasp (and several more leer).

Jessica barely has time to gasp herself, as the switch begins tattooing her vulnerable ass from top to bottom. It doesn't take long before the girl begins apologizing and pleading, but the flexible 
switch inexorably 
falls a full 24 times. The girl blubbers apologies, wetting the floor below her with her tears. 

"Now, girls, concentrate on the lesson!" says Airell as he lands the last of Jessica's stripes to her voluptuous, but now angrily red, behind. "Magic is too powerful to treat with irreverence. We're 
training for the battlefield. Never forget that!"

"Y-yes, sir!" the girls stutter through sniffles. The spectral bar that had been holding them so tightly dissipates, and each student rights herself. Jessica carefully pulls her panties up over her 
chubby behind with a wince. Both punished girls turn their attention back to the candle that Airell sets back on the desk. 

Finished with his unruly students, Airell turns his attention to the wailing \name{}, whose screams have begun to echo throughout the classroom. He sighs. "Excuse me, pupils," he says. He motions 
his hands in a way that makes the spectral versions holding Juliana's wrists bring them up over her head. Then, the other set \ptrousers{unbuttons \hisher{} trousers and begin sliding them down 
    \hisher{} 
hips.}{grabs the hem of \names{} \trousers{} and lifts it up and over \hisher{} throbbing bottom.}{yanks \names{} \underwearpanties{} up between \names{} \bumadj{} cheeks.} \name{} begins to protest 
but stops when Airell tuts. "That's enough out of you, naughty \boygirl{}. Class is nearly over, and if you want to get through it with any dignity at all, you will not interrupt 
again."

Now that they have mostly revealed their target, the hands return \name{} to her position of penitence and begin slapping \hisher{} ass right where they left off. \name{} resigns \himselfherself{} 
to the punishment. \HeShe{} wriggles \hisher{} butt lewdly, but manages to keep \hisher{} moans of pain muted enough to not draw more attention from Airell. 

There is no the students' lesson ended prematurely, but after what seems like an age to Juliana, Airell finishes his lecture and dismisses the class. Seeing that his ethereal hands have covered 
every inch of Juliana's bottom at least twice over (depending on the spot), he pauses them, and \pwearingunderwear{whisks down \hisher{} \underwear{}, and}{pats \hisher{} bare bottom, and} inspect 
their progress. 

After inspecting \hisher{} battered butt, Airell asks, "That should be enough to teach you not to interrupt the most important class in the guild, yes?" 

\name{} nods \hisher{} affirmation. 

"Good. Corner time for you, then!" exclaims Airell. "I will get to you shortly. Until then, you will stand silently with your nose pressed firmly against the wall, and you will keep your hands on 
your head until I say otherwise. Even think of deifying me, and I give you a very thorough demonstration of exactly what that spell is capable of."

The spectral hands gripping \names{} wrists loosen enough to free \himher{} of the stool. Once \name{} stands, they guide \himher{} toward the far corner of the room. \name{} hobbles quickly, but 
not quickly enough to prevent several more swats from the other pair of spectral hands. They dissipate (thank La Madre!) once \name{} is in the desired spot, where \heshe{} quickly does as 
instructed. Satisfied for now, Airell retires to the other end of the room to deal with paperwork.

Thirty minutes pass. Thirty minutes of staring at the most boring wall imaginable. Thirty minutes of shifting from foot to foot, trying to find some comfort for \hisher{} burning legs. Thirty
minutes of resisting every overpowering urge to rub \hisher{} throbbing, burning, pulsing bottom. 

"Very well! You may replace your clothing!" exclaims Airell. As \name{} eagerly takes him up on the offer, he opens his desk drawer, reaches into it and slides out a thick, 16-inch-long wooden 
paddle with two rows of holes running down its length. He then gets up from his desk and strides over to Juliana, tapping the paddle ominously against his thigh. "Now, Morey was attempting to teach 
you a very important lesson when he punished you, initiate. Do you remember what it was?"

"Yes, that is correct. Now, we shall drive that lesson home," says Airell as he sits on the stool and stands the ominous paddle up against a rear leg of the stool. "Over my knee, \boygirl{}!"

\name{} drapes \himselfherself{} over the slinger's lap, \hisher{} bottom stretching the fabric of \hisher{} \trousers{}. The spectral hands holding the stool adjust it to \names{} height, arcing 
the woman over Airell's thighs, making \hisher{} butt \hisher{} highest point, and \hisher{} toes barely touching the floor. 

"I hope you didn't think I'd use Spectral Spanking for meting out all my discipline! Even I believe that a corporeal aspect is sometimes needed when delivering corporal punishment," says Airell 
as he takes hold of Juliana's right hand in his left, and smacks \hisher{} behind with his right. 

If \name{} expected the slinger to be a weak bookworm, \heshe{} is sorely dissapointed. Airell's practiced hand rises and falls methodically across every part of \hisher{} \quivering{} behind while 
\heshe{} ineffectually squirms. 

"You'd just as well crease your movement right now, young \manlady{}." Airell tightens his grip on \name{}.

"You mean--OW! You mean 'cease'!" says \name{} between smacks. 

"Whatever! Don't you know better than to interrupt your instructors?" 

Airell hikes a knee up \ptrousers{so he can get to \names{} trouser buttons and undo them. Then he quickly shimmies the \trousers{} down \names{} \pmusculature{doughy}{fit}{solid} hips to 
bunch around \hisher{} knees.}{to push \names{} \muscleadj{} bottom higher into the air, and flips \names{} \trousers{} up onto the small of \hisher{} back}{to push \names{} \muscleadj{} bottom
higher into the air. Then he gathers \names{} \underwearpanties{} and yanks them up into \names{} crack, inflicting a deeply uncomfortable wedgie upon the chastised adventurer, and almost fully 
exposing \names{} \bumadj{} cheeks.}

"This" SMACK! "is" WHAP! "a very" SLAP! "important" CLAP! "lesson, my girl!" 

As Airell continues lecturing \name{} while manifesting his inflections with his hand against \bumadj{}, \pwearingunderwear{\underwear{}-covered}{bare} bottom, \name{} begins to wish \heshe{} 
had never antagonized Airell and begins to plead for him to stop.

"Very well!" says Airell to \names{} surprise. "However, I want to see nothing but bare skin below your waist and for you to bend over this stool intermittently. I'm a very busy man."

    "What. Did. You. Say?" roars Airell. If \name{} had had \hisher{} eyes on his, \heshe{} would have seen them flash. \HeShe{} only has a moment to consider whether the thunder \heshe{} just heard 
    was a coincidence as \heshe{} is jerked in the direction of the stool. \HeShe{} hops in midair as the holey paddle strikes \hisher{} \trousers{}-clad bottom with full force, but the slinger 
    maintains his harsh hold on \names{} appendage. \names{} \bumadj{} butt and thighs are battered with the hard paddle as the two slowly make their way to their destination despite \names{} 
    protests. 

    The sore-bottomed \boygirl{} and an angry slinger arrive at the stool, over which \name{} is roughly forced. Airell never stops swinging the paddle, tattooing the \boygirl{}'s bottom even 
    through \hisher{} \trousers{} \pwearingunderwear{and \underwearpanties{}}{}. 

    After Airell has covered \names{} entire \bumadj{} bottom with his hard swats, he tugs \hisher{} \trousers{} \pwearingunderwear{and \underwearpanties{}} down with a vengeance and repeats the 
    entire process on \hisher{} bare ass, which violently bounces left and right with Airell's staccato rhythm. \name{} is weeping openly by the time the slinger addresses \himher{} again, asking if 
    \heshe is ready to cooperate. Just as Airell finishes his sentence, \name{} hears a "whoosh" followed by a loud "SPLAT!" as the paddle slams into the very center of \hisher{} bottom harder than 
    it had before, covering both cheeks. The \boygirl{}'s tears flow freely as the swat is immediately followed up by another to the top of \hisher{} behind and a third directly on \hisher{} sit 
    spots. \name{} howls and drums \hisher{} feet against the floor but keeps a death grip on the stool's legs. 

    Airell gives \name{} a minute to get \himselfherself{} under control, after which \heshe{} realizes that holding \hisher{} position has required \himher{} to spread \hisher{} legs a bit,
    revealing all \hisher{} most sensitive bits to the slinger. \HeShe{}
    curses \himselfherself{} for getting \himselfherself{} in this situation.

    Airell inspects the considerable damage \heshe{} has wrought to the \boygirl{}'s \bumadj{} backside. "Hmm. You do seem to finally be acting sincerely, and with a bit of discipline. After a few 
    more strokes, you will be free to go."

"A-a f-f-few, sir?" 

"Aye. You're due seven more licks. To show mercy on this already battered bottom, I'll allow most of these to be on your thighs."

\name{} groans and contemplates challenging this sentence on account of having taken several swats to her thighs already, but decides not to risk any impertinence again. Besides, \heshe{} is 
pretty sure \hisher{} sensitive ass can't take much more punishment.

\HisHer{} reverie is quickly interrupted by four rapid swats, two to each thigh. \names{} tears run in a stream down \hisher{} face, but \heshe{} somehow maintains \hisher{} position. Then two more 
strokes land on the same spots. \HeShe{} begins to moan as the final stroke is swung, landing directly on \hisher{} sit spot in a mighty "WHAP!"

\name{} is gently helped off the stool. Dressing is done with care and only after some tender rubbing. 

"Alright, we're done here," says Airell. He returns to his desk and returns the paddle to its place. "Now get out of here. I've got a sparring match with Morey in a few minutes."

\name{} hussles out of the classroom.

    As \name{} approaches Airell's training room, half a dozen students are filing out. Two of them, a buxom raven-haired girl, and a slender brunette glance at \name{} and giggle to themselves.
    \name{} ignores them, and enters Airell's training room.

    Airell is sitting behind a desk in the far corner, riffling through sheets of parchment. \name{} shakes \hisher{} head in bemusement. \HeShe{} would have to thank Nana for forcing \himher{}
    to learn how to read. It'd be so embarassing, being illiterate while surrounded by all this writing.

    "Ah, \name{}," says Airell, breaking into a broad grin. "Finally hear to pay for your blatant disrespect?"

    \names{} lips tighten, and \heshe{} nods.

    Airell nods, and waves his hand. A pair of small spectral hands appear in the air above him. \name{} tenses, but the hands instead float over and grasp a stool sitting in front
    of the room. Airell flicks his wrists a few times, and the hands lift and carry the stool towards \name{}. "Good. Now bare your bottom and bend over that stool."

    "Bare? Oh come on, it wasn't--"

    "Indeed it wasn't, but it's taken you a full month to report for your chastisement!" roars Airell, bolting to his feet. "A month! I've known elves with more spine than you! Now bend over that
    stool intermittently! I'm a very busy man!"

"You have taken your paddling so far with discipline, which I respect," says Airell. "After a few more strokes, you will be free to go."

"A-a f-f-few, sir?" 

"Aye. You'll only be getting the minimum of 10 today, and to show mercy on this already battered bottom, I'll allow most of the remainder to be on your thighs."

\name{} groans but decides not to risk "interfering" again. Besides, \heshe{} is pretty sure \hisher{} sensitive ass can't take much more punishment.

\HisHer{} reverie is quickly interrupted by four rapid swats, two to each thigh. \names{} tears run in a stream down \hisher{} face, but \heshe{} somehow maintains \hisher{} position as two more

\name{} is gently helped off the stool. Dressing is done with care and only after some tender rubbing. 

"We are done here," says Airell. He returns to his desk, and replaces the paddle in its drawer. "You are free to go. And remember what you learned here: You will treat me with the utmost respect

"Yes sir," mutters \name{} as \heshe{} scurries out of that accursed classroom.

    \name{} doesn't have time to finish \hisher{} sentence before \heshe{} is yanked up onto \hisher{} feet, had \hisher{} \ptrousers{\trousers{} \pwearingunderwear{and \underwearpanties{}}{}

        wood to \hisher{} right and doesn't have to guess that the paddle is being brought to bear, as it crashes into \hisher{} already-sore bottom with a sharp "WHAP!"

        Airell pummels the Taironan's bottom with the heavy instrument, the impacts of which shake \hisher{} round globes as gale winds shake trees. \name{} squeals and bucks, succeeding in nothing 
        but offering fresh territory to \hisher{} punisher. As \hisher{} thighs part, Airell dexterously swats their interiors, making sure that \name{} will be walking (as well as sitting) gingerly 
        for quite some time. 

        Eventually, the \boygirl{} stops fighting Airell and moans apologetically as hot tears roll down \hisher{} face. This time, when asked if \heshe{} will put \himselfherself{} in position for 
        \hisher{} final swats, \heshe{} quickly climbs off the slinger's lap. \HeShe{} bends over the stool and grasps toward the bottom of the legs furthest from her. The specral hands holding the
