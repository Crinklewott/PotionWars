\begin{node}{ep1 guard greeting}{Edge of Avaricum}{southGuard}{Andrew Russell}

The guard on the south side of the road blocks \names{} path with an arm. 
    He is a broad-shouldered, heavily muscled brute of a man. At over six feet tall, he towers over just about everyone else on the road. The large, steel-tipped
    spear he carries only adds to his intimidating appearance. "I'd like to ask you a few questions."

\name{} hesitates for a moment, then steps onto the side of the road, making sure to keep \hisher{} distance. 

"What's your name?" asks the guard.

\name{} grimaces. Although, there's nothing stopping \himher{} from giving a fake name...

    \child{"I am."}{ep1 question 2 answer}

    The guard nods.

\begin{childnode}{ep1 guard questions 3 business}{Andrew Russell}

The guard scowls. "It is my business, because the safety of this city is my business."

"What does the last time I was in Bonda have to do with the safety of this city?" asks \name{}, crossing \hisher{} arms over \hisher{} chest.

"There has been a rash of attacks against this city by a Taironan terrorist group calling themselves the Harapiento Vengadores-"

"And because I'm Taironan you naturally assume I'm involved," snaps \name{}.

"I'm tempted," says the guard in a low growl. "These are exclusively Taironan rebels. Focusing on Taironans is a lot easier than questioning everyone. Now, are you going to answer my questions, or 
will I have to haul you off to the guardhouse to be questioned there?"

\child{"The Tyrant take you."}{ep1 guardhouse}

"You've never been to Bonda? I find that hard to believe," says the guard.

"You do realize the Taironans are an entire civilization with well over a dozen major city-states, dozens more smaller towns, and hundreds of villages, right?" says \name{} testily. "I was born and 
raised in Chengue, an unremarkable city-state of average wealth and minor influence. Even when conditions are good, it takes a week to reach Bonda from there."

The guard studies \name{} for a minute, obviously trying to decide if \heshe{} is lying. Then, he shrugs. "Very well."

\continue{ep1 guard questions 4}

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{ep1 guard questions 3 truth}{Andrew Russell}

    "I see," says the guard. He studies \name{} for a moment, probably trying to decide if \heshe{} looks young enough for \hisher{} story to make sense. He nods, apparently satisfied.

"Reyna of Chengue," says \name{}.

"Sorry to hear that," says the guard.

the streets."

"Of course," says \name{}.

    "Fine." The guard grabs \name{} by the scruff of \hisher{} neck and spins \himher{} around. \name{} glances over \hisher{} shoulder and sees the guard reach for a thick loop of rope at his belt.

    \child{Resist.}{ep1 guardhouse resist}

    \child{Go quietly.}{ep1 guardhouse go quietly}

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{ep1 guardhouse resist}{Andrew Russell}

    \name{} rams \hisher{} elbow into the guard's gut, then pushes him to the ground. \HeShe{} makes a break for the city proper, hoping to lose \himselfherself{} in the crowds.

However, the other guard has cut \himher{} off.  \name{} scrambles to change direction, when something hard and heavy slams into \himher{} from behind, throwing \himher{} to the ground. \HeShe{} looks over \hisher{} shoulder, and sees the first guard 
straddling \hisher{} prone form.

The guard grabs \names{} wrists, and binds them tightly together behind \hisher{} back.
    Then, he gives \name{} a quick pat down, taking \hisher{} weapon in the process. Finally, the guard pulls \himher{} to \hisher{} feet.

    \continue{guardhouse 1}

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{ep1 guardhouse go quietly}{Andrew Russell}

\name{} stands quietly while the guard gives \himher{} a brief, professional patdown, taking \hisher{} dagger in the process. Then he ties \names{} hands behind \hisher{} back, and pushes \himher{} towards the guardhouse.
    "Let's go," he says. "Don't want to hold up the line any more than you already have." 

    \continue{guardhouse 1}

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{guardhouse 1}{Andrew Russell}

    \keyword{'spoke\_to\_guard'}

    \name{} is led across the street and into a small stone building sitting just off the road. The 
    inside of the guardhouse is a single large room. There is an uncomfortable looking armless 
    chair in the center, and a small desk and chair pushed against the northeast corner. Sitting at 
    the desk, hunched over some paperwork, is a woman wearing a slender black dress with red trim. 
    Frizzy blond hair sticks out from underneath a black beret. Sewn onto the beret is a patch. 
    The background of the patch is a pair of crossed shepherd's crooks, juxtaposed on top of which 
    is a female string puppet.
This woman is a puppeteer who studied at Stasia University, the preeminent University in the known 
world.
The woman looks up impatiently. Her cold blue eyes sweep over both \name{} 
and the guard. \name{} represses a shiver. "Another one?"

"Er, yes ma'am," says the guard, nervously fidgeting with his weapon.

The woman returns to her paperwork. "So beat \himher{} until \heshe{} tells you what you want to 
know. I've got work to do."

"But the commander's orders," stammers the guard. "He said to-"

"I know what Sir Roland said," snaps the woman. She glares at the man, and he takes a step back. 
She flicks her quill at \name{}. "I see \himher{}. \HeShe{} is definitely a Taironan. Now lock
\himher{} in the stocks or something, and stop bothering me."

"And if Sir Roland finds out you didn't, er, deal with \himher{}?" asks the guard.

The woman shifts in her seat. She glares at the guard a second time, though this time the guard 
doesn't back up. "And you'd report me of course."

"I have a job to do," says the guard. He sets his jaw, and matches the woman's stare. "And so do 
you."

The woman sighs, and rubs her eyes. "Fine, fine, fine. Go on back to your post like a good little 
soldier. I'll take care of little \mistermiss{} dumbass, here."

\child{"Watch who you're insulting you overeducated tramp."}{ep1 guardhouse rude}

\child{Say nothing.}{ep1 guardhouse say nothing}

\child{"That was uncalled for."}{ep1 guardhouse polite}

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{ep1 guardhouse rude}{Andrew Russell}

The woman raises an eyebrow. "We've got a feisty one here."

"You have no idea," growls \name{}.

The woman smirks. "Never have I met so terrifying a \manwoman{}. Why, if it wasn't for the fact 
that you're unarmed and have your hands tied behind your back, I don't know what I'd do."

The woman throws \name{} a surprised glance. "Thought you said \heshe{} was being uncooperative."

"Maybe you've scared \himher{}," says the guard.

The woman shrugs. "Whatever. Let's get this over with."

\continue{ep1 charmed}

\end{childnode}

\begin{childnode}{ep1 charmed}{Andrew Russell}

The woman stands. She's rather tall, close to six feet. She stands with her back straight and her 
shoulders back. As she steps around the desk, a pair of (silk!) slippers peek out from underneath 
her near floor-length dress.
The guard hands the woman \names{} \weapon{}, then salutes and leaves.
The woman \cond{universal.state.player.weapon().weaponType != items.Spear.weaponType()}{puts the \weapon{} on the desk,}{rests the 
spear against the wall,} and approaches \name{}. She grabs 
\names{} chin in an iron grip. "Look deeply into my eyes."
    Her voice has taken on a soothing, melodic tone. Her pupils fill her eyes. Then they open into 
a bottomless pit, and \name{} starts to fall.
    '"You and I are the greatest of friends." The voice reverberates throughout the universe. It 
makes \names{} skin tingle, and \hisher{} hair stand on end. "You trust me with everything."
